<p class="h2a">PART ONE</p>

<p class="h2a">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="cap">OH, but this is terrible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura Pavely did not raise her voice, but there
was trembling pain, as well as an almost incredulous
surprise, in the way she uttered the five words which
may mean so much&mdash;or so little.</p>

<p class="indent">The man whose sudden, bare avowal of love had
drawn from her that low, protesting cry, was standing
just within the door of the little summer-house,
and he was looking away from her, straight over the
beautiful autumnal view of wood and water spread
out before him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was telling himself that five minutes ago&mdash;nay,
was it as long as five minutes?&mdash;they had been so
happy! And yet, stop&mdash;<i>he</i> had not been happy. Even
so he cursed himself for having shattered the fragile,
to him the already long perished, fabric, of what she
no doubt called their "friendship."</p>

<p class="indent">It was she&mdash;it always is the woman&mdash;who, quite unwittingly,
had provoked the words which now could
never be unsaid. She had not been thinking at all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
of him when she did so&mdash;she had spoken out of her
heart, the heart which some secret, sure instinct bade
him believe capable of depths of feeling, which
he hoped, with a fierce hope, no man had yet
plumbed....</p>

<p class="indent">What had provoked his avowal had been the most
innocent, in a sense the most beautiful, feeling of
which a woman is capable&mdash;love for her child.</p>

<p class="indent">"The doctor says Alice ought to have a change, that
she ought to go to the sea, for a little while. I asked
Godfrey if I might take her, but he said he didn't
think it necessary." She had added musingly, "It's
odd, for he really is devoted to the child."</p>

<p class="indent">They had been walking slowly, sauntering side by
side, very close to one another, for the path was only
a narrow track among the trees, towards the summerhouse
where they were now&mdash;she sitting and he standing.</p>

<p class="indent">He had answered in what, if she had been less absorbed
in herself and her own concerns, she might
have realised was a dangerously still voice: "I think I
can persuade Godfrey to let her go. Apart from the
child altogether, you ought to have a change." And
then&mdash;then she had said, rather listlessly, not at all
bitterly, "Oh, it doesn't matter about me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Such a simple phrase, embodying an obvious truth,
yet they had forced from him the words: "I think it
does matter about you, Laura. At least I know it
matters a good deal to me, for, as of course you know
by now, I love you."</p>

<p class="indent">And if his voice had remained quite low and steady,
she had seen the blazing, supplicating eyes....</p>

<p class="indent">But he had looked away, at once, when he had uttered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
those irrevocable words; and after a few moments,
which had seemed to him an eternity, had come
that low, heart-felt cry, "Oh, but this is terrible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Terrible? Why, Laura?" He crossed his arms,
and turning, gazed straight down at her bowed figure.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there came a long, unnatural pause.</p>

<p class="indent">And then she lifted up her face, and under the
shadow cast by her wide-brimmed garden hat he saw
that even her forehead was flushed. There was an
anguished look in the large, deeply blue eyes, which
were to him the most exquisite and revealing feature
of her delicately drawn face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps I ought not to have said 'terrible,'" she
said at last in a low voice, "but&mdash;but degrading, ignoble,
<i>hateful</i>, Oliver." She added, her false calm giving
way, "And to me such a bitter, bitter disappointment!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?" he asked harshly. "Why a disappointment,
Laura? Most women, nay, all wise human beings,
value love&mdash;any kind of love offered by even the
most unworthy&mdash;as the most precious thing in the
world!"</p>

<p class="indent">His face had become expressionless, and the measured,
carefully chosen words made her feel suddenly
ashamed, but with a shame merged in an eager hope
that she had cruelly misunderstood her&mdash;friend.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood up and took a step towards him.
"Oliver," she said diffidently; "forgive me! I was
stupid not to understand. Of course we love one another,"
she was on firm ground now. "All friends
love one another, and you've been such a good friend
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
to me, and more, far more, than a good friend to my
poor brother&mdash;to Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">He withdrew his gaze from her beseeching eyes, and
looked away once more. Now was his chance to play
the hypocrite, to eat the words which had given her
so much offence....</p>

<p class="indent">Hardly knowing that he spoke aloud, he muttered
hoarsely, "I can't!" And then he turned to her:
"Listen, Laura. I owe you the truth. I have loved
you, yes, and in the sense you think so ignoble and
so degrading, almost from the first day we met. As
time went on, I thought it impossible that you did not
know that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I did not know it! I trusted you absolutely! I
thought that we were all three, friends,&mdash;you and I
and Godfrey! It was the very first time that Godfrey
and I had ever had a friend in common, and it made
me so happy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did it indeed?" His words cut like a whip.</p>

<p class="indent">"But it's true that you are Godfrey's friend?" she
spoke a little wildly. "I've never known him as fond
of any man as he is now of you, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">"His fondness is not returned."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it ought to be!" she cried. "For you've made
him like you, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">She hardly knew what she was saying, distressed,
humiliated, wounded as she was in her pride and sense
of personal dignity. But what was he saying&mdash;this
challenging, wrathful stranger who, but a few moments
ago, had been her dear, dear friend?</p>

<p class="indent">"I would rather, Laura, that you did not bring your
husband into this matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I must bring him in!" She became suddenly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
aware that here ready to her hand was a weapon with
which she could hurt and punish this man who was
looking at her with so inscrutable a look&mdash;was it a
look of love or of hatred?</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry now," she went on rapidly, "bitterly, bitterly
sorry and ashamed that I ever said a word to
you of Godfrey and his&mdash;his rather tiresome ways. I
ought not to have done it. It was disloyal. I've never
spoken of Godfrey to any other man&mdash;but somehow
I thought <i>you</i> were different from other men."</p>

<p class="indent">"Different?" he interjected. "How so, Laura?
What right had you to think me different from other
men?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I trusted you," she said inconsequently.
"Because somehow you seemed really to care for
me&mdash;" her voice broke, but she forced herself to go
on: "You're not the first man, Oliver, who's made love
to me since I married&mdash;" she covered her face with
her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to her that some other woman was being
driven to make these intimate confidences&mdash;not the
fastidious, refined, reserved Laura Pavely, who had
an almost morbid dislike of the betrayal of any violent
or unseemly emotion. But this other woman, who
spoke through her lips, had been, was being, wantonly
insulted....</p>

<p class="indent">Hanging her head as a child might have done, she
said defiantly: "I suppose you're surprised?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I'm not surprised. Why should I be? Go
on&mdash;" He clenched his hands together. What was
it she was going to tell him?</p>

<p class="indent">Speaking in short, broken sentences, she obeyed
him:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
"It was when we used to go about much more than
we do now&mdash;in the first two or three years after our
marriage. I suppose that every woman&mdash;who isn't
quite happy with her husband&mdash;is exposed to that
kind of thing. I used to loathe it when I saw it coming.
I used to try and fend it off. Sometimes I succeeded&mdash;more
often I failed. But I never, never expected
anything of the sort to happen with you, Oliver.
We were such friends&mdash;such good, happy friends&mdash;you
and I and my little Alice," and then she burst into
a passion of weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">And at that what self-control Oliver Tropenell had
retained departed. A flood of burning, passionate
words burst from his lips&mdash;of endearment, of self-abasement,
and promises which he intended, come what
might, should be kept.</p>

<p class="indent">And she listened shrinkingly, with averted face, absorbed
in her own bewildered pain and disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must go back to the house," she said at last.
"The doctor will be here in half an hour." And she
forced herself to add: "Perhaps you'll be coming over
this afternoon?" (How often she had said these words
in the last three months&mdash;but in how different a tone!).</p>

<p class="indent">"I think not. My mother said something about
wishing me to stay in to-day&mdash;Lord St. Amant may
be coming over." As she made no comment, he concluded
quietly, "Well, I suppose I had better be going
now. Good-bye, Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye," she said. And without taking her hand
he left her.</p>

<p class="indent">She watched his tall figure making its way quickly
down through the rough ground to the wood where,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
ultimately, he would find a path which would lead
him to his mother's house.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was late in the afternoon of the same day. From
where she was sitting, under a great cedar tree, Mrs.
Tropenell at last saw her son Oliver and Godfrey
Pavely come out of Freshley Manor.</p>

<p class="indent">Though the glory and warmth of the summer were
now over, Mrs. Tropenell still spent many hours of
each day in her garden. She had always been an out-of-door
woman from the days when she was an eager,
impetuous, high-spirited girl, till now, when youth
had gone, though something of the eager impetuosity
of youth remained with her concealed from strangers
by a manner marked by a strong sense of personal
dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men began walking, slowly, down the grass
path leading to the beech avenue which was the glory
of Freshley Manor, as well as a short cut to Lawford
Chase, Godfrey Pavely's larger property.</p>

<p class="indent">It was more than an hour since a servant had come
out to say that Mr. Pavely was waiting to see Mr.
Tropenell in the library. The man had added that
Mr. Pavely had had tea before leaving the Bank,
and only wanted to see Mr. Tropenell for a few minutes
on his way home. And Oliver, with "I don't
think he'll keep me long, mother; I suppose you'll
still be here when I come back?" had stridden off
with a certain reluctance towards the house.</p>

<p class="indent">It had always been his mother's joy, but now for
many years past her infrequent joy, to fall in with
even the least reasonable of her son's wishes, and so
she had gone on sitting out there, waiting for him to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
come back, long after the tea-things had been taken
away. There was a book on the low garden table
by her side&mdash;such a book as she loved, telling of great
adventure by one of the adventurers&mdash;but she left it
where it was.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell felt a vague, exasperating sense of
restlessness and unease. At the back of her heart&mdash;that
heart which, if no longer that of a young woman,
could still thrill with many varied emotions and a very
passion of maternal love&mdash;was the dull ache of a secret,
unacknowledged sense of fear and pain.</p>

<p class="indent">She had every reason to be happy to-day&mdash;not only
happy in her son's company, but in the coming back,
after a long absence on the Continent, of her old
friend, Lord St. Amant. To him she could, perhaps,
bring herself to say something of what was touching
her so deeply, and he, she knew, would reassure her
and make light of her fears. St. Amant was what is
called in ordinary parlance a man of the world&mdash;the
last man, that is, to be horrified, still less frightened,
by a tale of illicit love, especially when, as the mother
honestly believed, it was a love likely to remain unrequited.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, she would tell her one trusted friend of these
besetting fears, of her more than suspicion that her
son Oliver was deep in love with Laura Pavely, and
St. Amant would laugh at her, persuade her maybe to
laugh with him.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet? Yet, even so, she asked herself again
and again during that long time of waiting, what these
two men who, if of life-long acquaintanceship and
now at any rate nominally intimate friends, were so
unlike the one to the other, could have to talk about,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
indoors, for over an hour? Godfrey Pavely and
Oliver Tropenell met very often&mdash;too often to her
thinking&mdash;so why should Godfrey have pursued Oliver
home to-day, just when Oliver had had an hour to
spare for his mother?</p>

<p class="indent">It was now Thursday, and her son had already dined
with the Pavelys twice this week. To-morrow night
Godfrey Pavely was to be in London, and it had
been arranged that his wife, Laura, should spend the
evening here. But that, or so Mrs. Tropenell had
quickly reminded herself, had been Laura's usual custom,
long before Oliver had come home from Mexico
for the holiday which had now already lasted nearly
four months. In her long life Mrs. Tropenell had
only had one beloved woman friend, and that friend,
that more than sister, had been Laura's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Even now Godfrey Pavely did not seem eager to go
home. The two men were close to the furthest edge
of the wide lawn, but they were still talking earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell gazed across, with a painful
scrutiny, at her son's visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely was a neatly made, neatly dressed,
neatly mannered man&mdash;in a way not ill-looking. His
reddish-brown hair toned in oddly with his light,
ginger-coloured eyes. He had become rather particular
about his health of late, and went to some trouble
to keep himself fit, and in good condition. Yet he
looked more like a townsman than like the countryman
he certainly was. For if the fortunate inheritor
of a successful county banking business, which so far
he had managed with such skill as to save it from any
thought of amalgamation, he was also the owner of a
fine old property.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
Lawford Chase had belonged to Mrs. Tropenell's
ancestors for centuries&mdash;for almost as many centuries
as the years in which he, Godfrey, had owned it. But
her father had been careless and extravagant during
his long, happy life, so the owner of Pavely's Bank
had bought up the mortgages on Lawford Chase, and
finally foreclosed.</p>

<p class="indent">All this was ancient history now, and Mrs. Tropenell
felt no bitterness on that account. Indeed, she had
rejoiced, with a sense of real joy, when her friend's
daughter had become mistress of her own old home.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men whom she was watching went on talking
for what seemed to the onlooker a very long time;
but, at last, Godfrey Pavely, turning on his heel,
walked on, to be at once engulfed by the dark green
arch formed by the high beech trees. Then Mrs.
Tropenell saw her son, all her heart welcoming him,
come striding towards her across the long stretch of
short, green turf.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more she asked herself what possible link
there could be between men so utterly unlike. Her
Oliver&mdash;more hers now, she felt, than ever before,
and that though for the first time he was making her
secretly, miserably jealous&mdash;was a creature of light
and air, of open spaces, if need be of great waters.
He was built, like herself, on a big and powerful plan;
and yet so tall, so spare, so sinewy, that though he
was broad he looked slim, and though four-and-thirty
years of age he might have been taken, even at this
small distance from where she sat, for a long-limbed
youth. His life for the last twelve years had been
one that often ages a man&mdash;but it had not aged him.
His vigour was unbroken, his vitality&mdash;the vitality
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
which had made him so successful, and which attracted
men and women of such very different types&mdash;unimpaired.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell had been touched, perhaps in her
secret heart little surprised, at the pleasure&mdash;one might
almost have said the enthusiasm&mdash;with which her
neighbours for miles round had welcomed Oliver home
again, after what had been so long an absence from
England. The fact that he had come back a very
wealthy man, and that during those years of eclipse
he had managed to do some of them good turns, of
course counted in his popularity, and she was too open-eyed
a woman not to be well aware of that.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother knew that her son was not the downright,
rather transparent, good-natured fellow that he
was now taken to be. No man she had ever known&mdash;and
she had ever been one of those women of whom
men make a confidant&mdash;could keep his own or another's
secrets more closely than could Oliver. He
had once written to her the words: "You are the only
human being, mother, to whom I ever tell anything,"
and she had instinctively known this to be true.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet their relationship was more like that of two
friends than of mother and son. She knew all there
was to know of his thoughts, and of his doubts, concerning
many of the great things which trouble and
disturb most thinking modern men. Of the outward
life he led in the Mexican stretch of country of which
he had become the administrator and practical ruler,
she also knew a great deal, indeed surprisingly much,
for he wrote by each mail long, full letters; and the
romance of his great business had become an ever
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
continuous source of interest, of amusement, and of
pride to the mother who now only lived for him.</p>

<p class="indent">But of those secret things which had moved his
heart, warred with his passions, perchance seared his
conscience, he had never told her anything. Only
once had the impenetrable mist of reserve been lightened,
as it were pierced for a moment&mdash;and that was
now a long time ago, on his second visit home five
years before. He had then come to England meaning
to stay a month. But at the end of ten days he had
received a telegram&mdash;what he called, in the American
fashion, a cable&mdash;and within an hour he had gone,
saying as he kissed his mother good-bye, "A friend
of mine&mdash;a woman who has been ill a long time&mdash;is
now dying. I must go, even if I'm not in time to see
her alive."</p>

<p class="indent">In the letters which had followed his return to Mexico,
there had been no word more&mdash;nothing even implying
sorrow, or a sense of loss&mdash;only a graver note,
of which the mother might have remained unaware
but for that clue he had left to sink deep in her
mother-heart.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">He was now close to her, looking down out of his
dark, compelling eyes&mdash;eyes which were so like her
own, save that now hers shone with a softer light.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pavely stayed a long time," he said abruptly. "Are
you tired? D'you want to go in yet, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head. "I'd rather stay out here till
it's time to dress."</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke she lifted her face to his, and he told
himself what a beautiful, and noble face it was, though
each delicate, aquiline feature had thickened, and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
broad low forehead was now partially concealed by
thick bands of whitening hair. It was a lined, even
a ravaged face&mdash;the face of a woman who had lived,
had loved, had suffered. But of that Oliver was only
dimly conscious, for his mother's nature if impetuous
and passionate was almost as reserved and secretive
as was his own.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be doubted, even, if Oliver Tropenell knew
how much his mother loved him, for it may be doubted
if any son ever knows how much his mother&mdash;even
if she appear placid or careless&mdash;loves him. One
thing Oliver did know, or confidently believed he knew,
and that was that his mother loved him more than
she had ever loved anything in the world. There he
was quite content to leave it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pavely wants me to become trustee to Laura's
marriage settlement, in succession to old Mr. Blackmore."</p>

<p class="indent">When with Godfrey Pavely, Oliver Tropenell always
called the other man by his Christian name, but
behind his back he always spoke of him as "Pavely."</p>

<p class="indent">As his mother remained silent, he went on, a little
hurriedly: "The powers vested in the trustee are very
wide, and it seems that money which was later added
to the trust&mdash;a matter of seventeen thousand pounds
or so&mdash;is invested in some queer form of security."</p>

<p class="indent">They both smiled&mdash;he a little drily, she with a kind
of good-humoured contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">"He's cautious and successful&mdash;in spite of that odd,
gambling propensity," she spoke a little defensively.
Then, "I suppose you've consented to act?"</p>

<p class="indent">She waited anxiously for his answer; and at last
it came, uttered in a tone of elaborate unconcern:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
"I said I'd think it over. But I think I'll take it on,
mother. Pavely made rather a personal favour of it&mdash;after
all, there's some kind of relationship."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," agreed Mrs. Tropenell, "yes, there is certainly
a connection, hardly a relationship, between
ourselves and Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">Her son sat down. He began poking about an invisible
stone, lying in among the grass, with his stick.</p>

<p class="indent">"You cared for Laura's mother as if she had been
your sister&mdash;didn't you, mother? And yet I can't imagine
you with a great woman friend, I mean, of
course, a friend of your own age."</p>

<p class="indent">She turned and looked at him. "Ah, my dear,&mdash;those
are the friends that count!" and she nearly
added, "Don't <i>you</i> find it so?" But, instead, she went
on quickly, "Yes, I loved Laura's mother dearly, dearly&mdash;and
it was for her sake that I asked you to be good
to her son, to Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Laura's extraordinarily fond of Gillie&mdash;&mdash;" There
always came a curious change over Oliver Tropenell's
voice when he uttered the name "Laura." It became
as it were softer, infused with feeling&mdash;or so his
mother thought.</p>

<p class="indent">She waited a moment; then answered slowly,
"Women generally are fond of their only brothers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but it's more than that!"</p>

<p class="indent">As she remained silent, he went on musingly: "And
Gillie, in his queer way, is very fond of Laura&mdash;though
I don't believe he writes to her once in three
months!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose Gillie still hates Godfrey?" she said hesitatingly.
"Godfrey behaved so&mdash;so&mdash;well, not so
much badly perhaps, as meanly and even stupidly&mdash;about
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
that unfortunate affair." It was almost as if
Mrs. Tropenell were speaking to herself. Her son
turned and looked at her squarely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes! Gillie still hates Pavely. And yet, mother,
since I came home this time I've wondered sometimes
if Pavely was so very unreasonable about it after all.
You see, Gillie must have been about the most troublesome
and&mdash;well, the most dangerous brother-in-law
an unlucky country banker could well have had!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And but for you he'd be so still," she said quietly.
"From something Godfrey said the other day I gather
that he's really grateful to you, Oliver?"</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell got up. "Yes," he said shortly,
"he's certainly grateful. In fact, he seems to think
I've limitless power of getting people out of
scrapes&mdash;&mdash;" there was an undercurrent of triumph
in his deep, even tones.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose the real reason he came to-day was that
he's afraid to let a stranger be Laura's trustee?"
There was only the slightest touch of interrogation
in Mrs. Tropenell's voice, and she went on: "Perhaps
he'd be kinder to poor Gillie <i>now</i>&mdash;" a curious smile
played round her mouth. It was a full-lipped, generous
mouth, but it was the least refined feature of her
face.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no. It's not as bad as that! But well, yes,
Pavely <i>has</i> used this portion of Laura's fortune in a
way he had no business to do, knowing it was trust
money."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I'm going to buy out her interest in the concern."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will that cost you seventeen thousand pounds?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
"Yes, it will. But I don't mind&mdash;it's quite a likely
gamble. Have you ever heard of Greville Howard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean the great money-lender?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He's retired now. But Pavely and he seem to be
in a kind of secret partnership&mdash;queer isn't it? Pavely's
a clever chap about money, but oh, mother!
he's such an insufferable cad!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell felt a sudden tremor of fear sweep
over her. She had lately come to what she now realised
was a quite wrong conclusion&mdash;she had believed,
that is, that Oliver, in a queer, contemptuous way,
had grown fond of Godfrey, as Godfrey had certainly
grown fond of Oliver. But now, all at once,
her son had opened a dark window into his soul&mdash;or
was it into his heart? There was an under-current
of hatred, as well as of the contempt to which she
was accustomed, in the way Oliver had just spoken
of his "friend"&mdash;of the man, at once fortunate and
unfortunate, who was Laura Pavely's husband.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood up, and put her hand through her son's
arm. "It's getting very cold," she said, and shivered.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned on her with quick concern: "I left you
too long! I ought to have sent him away before&mdash;but
he was such a long time getting it out&mdash;" under
his breath he muttered "Damn him!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="cap">MOTHER and son dined alone together, and then,
rather early, Mrs. Tropenell went upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">For a while, perhaps as long as an hour, she sat
up in bed, reading. At last, however, she turned off
the switch of her electric reading lamp, and, lying
back in her old-fashioned four-post bed, she shut her
eyes for a few moments. Then she opened them,
widely, on to her moonlit room.</p>

<p class="indent">Opposite to where she lay the crescent-shaped bow-window
was still open to the night air and the star-powdered
sky. On that side of Freshley Manor the
wide lawn sloped down to a belt of water meadows,
and beyond the meadows there rose steeply a high,
flat-topped ridge.</p>

<p class="indent">Along this ridge Oliver Tropenell was now walking
up and down smoking. Now and again his mother
saw the shadow-like figure move across the line of
her vision.</p>

<p class="indent">At one moment, last winter, she had feared that he
would not be able to come back this year, as troubles
had arisen among his cattle-men. But, as was Oliver's
way, he had kept his promise. That he had been able
to so do was in no small measure owing to his partner,
Gilbert Baynton.</p>

<p class="indent">Gilbert Baynton&mdash;<i>Laura Pavely's brother</i>? Of
that ne'er-do-weel Oliver had made from a failure a
success; from a waster&mdash;his brother-in-law, Godfrey
Pavely, would have called him by a harsher name&mdash;an
acute and a singularly successful man of business.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Lying there, her brain working quickly in the darkness,
Oliver's mother told herself that the Pavelys,
both Godfrey and Laura, had indeed reason to be
grateful, not only to Oliver, but to her, Oliver's
mother! It was to please her, not them, that Oliver,
long years ago, had accepted the dubious gift of
Gilbert Baynton, and the small sum Gilbert's brother-in-law
had reluctantly provided to rid himself of an intolerable
incubus and a potential source of disgrace.
Godfrey Pavely was certainly grateful, and never
backward in expressing it. And Laura? Laura was
one of your silent, inarticulate women, but without
doubt Laura must be grateful too.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At last Oliver left the ridge, and Mrs. Tropenell
went on gazing at the vast expanse of luminous sky
which merged into the uplands stretching away for
miles beyond the boundaries of her garden.</p>

<p class="indent">She lay, listening intently, and very soon she heard
the cadence of his firm footfalls on the stone path
below the window. Then came the quiet unlatching of
the garden door. Now he was coming upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Her whole heart leapt out to him&mdash;and perchance
it was this strong shaft of wordless longing that
caused Oliver Tropenell's feet to linger as he was
going past his mother's door.</p>

<p class="indent">Following a sudden impulse, she, who had trained
herself to do so few things on impulse, called out, "Is
that you, my darling?"</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened. "Yes, mother. Here I am. May
I come in?"</p>

<p class="indent">He turned and shut out the bright electric light on
the landing, and walked, a little slowly and uncertainly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
in the darkness, towards where he knew the bed to be.
For a moment she wondered whether she should turn
on the lamp which was at her elbow, then some sure,
secret instinct made her refrain.</p>

<p class="indent">She put out her hand, and pulled him down to her,
and he, so chary of caress, put his left arm round her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother?" he said softly. "This dear old room!
It's years since I've been in this room&mdash;and yet from
what I can see, it's exactly the same as it always was!"</p>

<p class="indent">And, as if answering an unspoken question, she
spoke in very low tones, "Hardly altered at all since
the day you were born here, my dearest, on the happiest
day of my life."</p>

<p class="indent">His strong arm tightened about her a little, and,
still looking straight before her, but leaning perhaps
a little closer into the shelter of his arm, she said tremulously,
inconsequently it might have seemed: "Oliver?
Are you going to accept Lord St. Amant's invitation?"</p>

<p class="indent">With a sharp shoot of hidden pain she felt his
movement of recoil, but all he said was, very quietly, "I've
not quite made up my mind, mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"It would give me pleasure if you were to do so.
He has been a very good and loyal friend to me for
a long, long time, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that."</p>

<p class="indent">She waited a moment, then forced herself to go
on: "You were never quite fair to St. Amant, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I feared him, mother."</p>

<p class="indent">And then, as she uttered an inarticulate murmur of
pain and of protest, he went on quickly, "The fear
didn't last very long&mdash;perhaps for two or three years.
You see I was so horribly afraid that you were going
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
to marry him." In the darkness he was saying something
he had never meant, never thought to say.</p>

<p class="indent">And she answered, "It was a baseless fear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it? I wonder if it was! Oh, of course I
know you are telling me the truth as you see it now&mdash;but,
but surely, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Surely no, Oliver. It is true that St. Amant wished,
after his wife's death, that I should marry him, but
he soon saw that I did not wish it, that nothing was
further from my wish&mdash;then."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Then?</i>" he cried. "What do you mean, mother?
Lady St. Amant only died when I was fifteen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I would like to tell you what I mean. And after
I have told you, I wish never to speak of this subject
to you again. But I owe it to myself as well as to
you, to tell you the truth, Oliver. Where is your
hand?" she said, "let me hold it while I tell you."</p>

<p class="indent">And then slowly and with difficulty she began
speaking, with a hesitation, a choosing of her words,
which were in sharp contrast to her usual swift decision.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to begin by telling you," her voice was
very low, "that according to his lights&mdash;the lights
of a man of the world and of, well yes, of an English
gentleman&mdash;St. Amant behaved very well as far as
I was concerned. I want you to understand that,
Oliver, to understand it thoroughly, because it's the
whole point of my story. If St. Amant had behaved
less well, I should have nothing to tell&mdash;you."</p>

<p class="indent">She divined the quiver of half-shamed relief which
went through her son. It made what she wished to
say at once easier and more difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">"As I think you know, I first met St. Amant when
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
I was very young, in fact before I was 'out,' and he
was the first really clever, really attractive, and, in a
sense, really noted man I had ever met. And then"&mdash;she
hesitated painfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"And then, mother?" Oliver's voice was hard and
matter-of-fact. He was not making it easy for her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, my dear, very very soon, he made of me
his friend, and I was of course greatly flattered, but
at that time, in the ordinary sense of the word, St.
Amant never made love to me." She went on more
firmly. "Of course I soon came to know that he
cared for me in a way he did not care for the other
women with whom his name was associated. I knew
very soon too, deep in my heart, that if his wife&mdash;his
frivolous, mean-natured, tiresome wife&mdash;died, he
certainly would wish to marry me, and for years, Oliver,
for something like six years, I daily committed
murder in my heart."</p>

<p class="indent">And then something happened which troubled and
greatly startled the woman who was making this painful
confession. Her son gave a kind of cry&mdash;a stifled
cry which was almost a groan. "God! How well I
understand that!" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you, Oliver&mdash;do you? And yet I, looking
back, cannot understand it! All that was best, indeed
the only good that was in St. Amant to give I had
then, and later, after I became a widow, I had it
again."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose he was much the same then as later, or&mdash;or
was he different then, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">She knew what he meant. "He was the same then,"
she said quietly, "but somehow I didn't care! Girls
were kept so ignorant in those days. But of course
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
the whole world knew he was a man of pleasure, and
in time I grew to know it too. But still it wasn't that
which made me unhappy, for I did not realise what
the phrase meant, still less what was implied by it.
But even so, as time went on I was very unhappy.
Mine was a false position&mdash;a position which hurt my
pride, and, looking back, I suppose that there must
have soon been a certain amount of muffled talk. If
I was not jealous, other women were certainly jealous
of me."</p>

<p class="indent">She waited for a few moments; the stirring of these
long-dead embers was hurting her more than she
would have thought possible.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she went on: "Sometimes months would
pass by without our meeting, but he wrote to me
constantly, and on his letters&mdash;such amusing, clever, and
yes, tender letters&mdash;I lived. My aunt, my father, both
singularly blind to the state of things, were surprised
and annoyed that I didn't marry, and, as for me, I
grew more and more unhappy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor mother!" muttered Oliver. And she sighed
a sigh of rather piteous relief. She had not thought
he would understand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know what I should have done but for two
people, your father, who of course was living here
then, our nearest neighbour, and, what meant very
much more to me just then, Laura's mother, Alice
Tropenell. Though she was only a very distant relation,
she was like a daughter in this house. Alice
was my one friend. She knew everything about me.
She was&mdash;well, Oliver, I could never tell you what
she was to me then!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
"I suppose," he said slowly, "that Laura is like
her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Laura?" Mrs. Tropenell could not keep the surprise
out of her low voice. "Oh no, my dear, Laura
is not in the least like her mother. But Laura's child
is very like Alice&mdash;even now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Laura's child?" Oliver Tropenell visioned the
bright, high-spirited, merry little girl, who somehow,
he could not have told her why, seemed often to be
a barrier between himself and Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">"Alice&mdash;my friend Alice&mdash;was full of buoyancy, of
sympathy for every living thing. She possessed what
I so much lacked in those days, and still alas! lack&mdash;sound
common-sense. And yet she, too, had her ideals,
ideals which did not lead her into a very happy path,
for Robert Baynton, high-minded though he may have
been, was absorbed in himself&mdash;there was no room
for any one else." Had she been telling her story
to any one but her son, Mrs. Tropenell would have
added, "Laura is very like him."</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, she continued, "No one but Alice would
have made Robert Baynton happy, or have made as
good a thing of the marriage as she did&mdash;for happy
they were. I think it was the sight of their happiness
that made me at last long for something different,
for something more normal in my life than that
strange, unreal tie with St. Amant. So at last, when
I was four-and-twenty, I married your father." Oliver
remained silent, and she said a little tremulously,
"He was very, very good to me. He made me a happy
woman. He gave me <i>you</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long, long pause. Mrs. Tropenell had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
now come to what was the really difficult part of the
task she had set herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are thinking, my boy, of <i>afterwards</i>." And
as she felt him move restlessly, she went on pleadingly,
"As to that, I ask you to remember that I
was very lonely after your father died. Still, if you
wish to know the real truth"&mdash;she would be very honest
now&mdash;"that friendship which you so much disliked
stood more in the way of your having a stepfather
than anything else could have done."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see that now," he said sombrely, "but I did not
see it then, mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"Even if Lady St. Amant had not lived on, as she
did, all those years, I should not have married St.
Amant&mdash;I think I can say that in all sincerity. So
you see, Oliver, you need not have been afraid, when
at last he became free."</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed a long, unconscious sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"I gather you still see him very often when he's at
Knowlton Abbey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, it's become a very comfortable friendship,
Oliver. But for St. Amant I should often feel very
lonely, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">She longed to go on&mdash;to tell Oliver how hard it
had been for her to build up her life afresh&mdash;after
he had finally decided to stay on in Mexico. But she
doubted if he would understand....</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he turned and kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-night," he said. "I'm grateful to you for
having told me all&mdash;all that you have told me, mother."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell hurried up the silent house. By his
own wish the large garret to which he had removed all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
his own treasures and boyish belongings after a delicate
childhood spent in a room close to his mother's,
was still in his room, and it had been very little altered.</p>

<p class="indent">It was reached by a queer, narrow, turning staircase
across which at a certain point a beam jutted
out too low. Tropenell never forgot to duck his head
at that point&mdash;indeed he generally remembered as he
did so how proud he had been the first time he had
found himself to be too tall to pass under it straightly!
But, strange to say, to-night he did forget&mdash;and for
a moment he saw stars.... Fool! Fool that he was
to allow his wits to go wool-gathering in this fashion!</p>

<p class="indent">With eyes still smarting, he leapt up the last few
steps to the little landing which he shared with no one
else. Opening the door he turned the switch of the
lamp on the writing-table which stood at a right angle
to the deep-eaved window.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he shut the door and locked it, and, after a
moment of indecision, walked across to the book-case
which filled up the space between the fireplace and the
inner wall of the long, rafted room.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not feel in the mood to go to bed, and idly
he let his eyes run over the long rows of books which
he had read, in the long ago, again and again, for like
most lonely boys he had been a great reader. They
were a good selection, partly his mother's, partly his
own, partly Lord St. Amant's. He knew well enough&mdash;he
had always known, albeit the knowledge gave
him no pleasure, that he had owed a great deal, as
boy and man, to his mother's old friend. Lord St.
Amant had really fine taste. It was he who had made
Oliver read Keats, Blake, Byron, Poe, among poets;
he who had actually given him <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
<i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, <i>Ali Baba of Ispahan</i>.
There they were all together.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not taken his books with him when he had
first gone to Mexico, for he had not meant to stay
there. But at last he had written home to a great London
bookseller and ordered fresh copies of all his old
books at home. The bookseller had naturally chosen
good editions, in some cases rare first editions. But
those volumes had never been read, as some of these
had been read, over and over and over again.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, to-night, he did not feel as if he could
commune with any comfort even with one of these
comfortable, unexacting friends. He felt too restless,
too vividly alive. So suddenly he turned away
from the bookcase, and looked about him. A large
French box-bed had taken the place of the narrow,
old-fashioned bedstead of his youth; and his mother
had had moved up to this room a narrow writing-table
from the study on the ground floor which no one ever
used.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked over to that writing-table now, and sat
down. On it, close to his left hand, stood a large
despatch-box. He opened and took out of it a square
sheet of paper on which was embossed his Mexican
address. Drawing two lines across that address, and
putting in the present date, September 19th, he waited,
his pen poised in his hand for a full minute.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he began writing rather quickly, and this is
what he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">My dear Laura</span>,&mdash;Godfrey suggests that I should
act as your trustee, in succession to Mr. Blackmore.
Am I to understand that this suggestion has your
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
approval? If yes, I will of course consent to act.
But please do not think I shall be offended if you
decide otherwise. You may prefer some woman of
your acquaintance. Women, whatever Godfrey may
tell you, make excellent men of business. They are,
if anything, over-prudent, over-cautious where money
is concerned; but that is a very good fault in a trustee."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">His handwriting was small and clear, but he had
left large spaces between the lines, and now he was at
the end of the sheet of paper. There was just room
for another sentence and his signature. He waited,
hesitating and of two minds, till the ink was dry, and
then he began again, close to the bottom of the sheet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"Before we meet again I wish to say one further
thing."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He put this first sheet aside, and took another of the
same size from the box by his side:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"You said something to-day which affected me painfully.
You spoke as if what I have done for your
brother caused you to carry a weight of almost intolerable
gratitude. So far as any such feeling should
exist between us, the gratitude should be on my side.
In sober truth Gillie has been invaluable to me.</p>

<p class="margin-left8">"I remain,</p>

<p class="margin-left16">"Yours sincerely,"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then very rapidly Oliver Tropenell made an "O"
and a "T," putting the T across the O so that any one
not familiar with his signature would be hard put to
it to know what the two initials were.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
He read over the words he had just written. They
seemed poor, inadequate, and he felt strongly tempted
to write the letter again, and word it differently. Then
he shook his head&mdash;no, let it stand!</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly he put the second sheet of the letter aside,
and placed the first one, on which the ink was dry,
before him. Then he looked round, with a queer, furtive
look, and, getting up, made sure the door was
locked.</p>

<p class="indent">Coming back to the writing-table, he took out of
the despatch-box lying there a small, square, crystal-topped
flagon of the kind that fits into an old-fashioned
dressing-case. The liquid in it was slightly, very
slightly, coloured, and looked like some delicate scent.</p>

<p class="indent">From the despatch-box also he now brought out a
crystal penholder with a gold nib. He dipped it in the
flagon, and began to write in between the lines of the
letter he had just written. As the liquid dried, the
slight marks made by the pen on the paper vanished,
for Oliver Tropenell was writing in invisible ink.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"The decks are cleared between us, Laura, for you
know now that I love you. You said, 'Oh, but this is
terrible!' Yes, Laura, love is terrible. It is not only
cleansing, inspiring, and noble, it is terrible also. Why
is it that you so misunderstand, misjudge, the one
priceless gift, the only bit of Heaven which God or
Nature&mdash;I care not which&mdash;has given to man and
woman? What you, judging by your words to-day,
take to be love is as little like that passion as a deep
draught of pure cold water to a man dying of thirst,
is like the last glass of drugged beer imbibed by some
poor sot already drunk."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Oliver Tropenell waited awhile. There were still
two spaces, before the bottom of the page of notepaper
was reached, and again he dipped the pen into
the strange volatile liquid.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"God bless you, my dear love," he wrote, "and grant
you the peace which seems the only thing for which
you crave."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He waited till the words had quite vanished, and
then he took up the two sheets of paper, folded them
in half, and put them in a large envelope which fitted
the paper when so folded. He wrote on the outside,
"Mrs. Pavely, Lawford Chase."</p>

<p class="indent">And then, turning out the light with a quick, nervous
gesture, he got up and went over to the long, low,
garret window.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments he saw nothing but darkness,
then the familiar scene unrolled below him and took
dim shape in the starlit night.</p>

<p class="indent">Instinctively his sombre eyes sought the place where,
far away to the right, was a dark patch of wood. It
was there, set amidst a grove of high trees, that stood
Lawford Chase, the noble old house which had been
his mother's early home, and which now contained
Laura Pavely, the woman to whom he had just written
two such different letters, and who for nearly
three months had never been out of his waking
thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">As his eyes grew more and more accustomed to the
luminous darkness, he saw the group of elms under
which this very day a word had unsealed the depths
of his heart, and where he had had the agony of seeing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Laura shrink, shudder, wilt as does a flower in a
breath of hot, f&oelig;tid air, under his avowal of love.</p>

<p class="indent">Violently he put that memory from him, and staring
out into the splendour of this early autumn night, he
tried to recapture the mixture of feelings with which
he had regarded Laura Pavely the first time they had
met since her marriage&mdash;the first time indeed since she
had been a shy, quiet little girl, and he an eager, highly
vitalised youth, five years older than herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking back now he realised that what had predominated
in his mind on that hot, languorous June
afternoon was astonishment at her utter unlikeness to
her brother, his partner, Gillie Baynton. It was an
astonishment which warred with the beckoning, almost
uncanny, fascination which her gentle, abstracted,
aloof manner effortlessly exercised over him. And
yet she had been (he knew it now, he had not known
it then) amazingly forthcoming&mdash;for her! As Mrs.
Tropenell's son he would have had a right to Laura
Pavely's regard, but he knew now that what had set
ajar the portals of her at once desolate and burdened
heart had been his kindness to, even his business relationship
with, her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie Baynton? Yes, it was to that disconcerting
and discordant human chord that their two natures&mdash;his
and Laura's&mdash;had perforce vibrated and mingled.
Remembering this, Oliver Tropenell reproved himself
for his past discontent with the partner who, whatever
his failings, had always shown him both gratitude and
a measure of such real affection as a man seldom shows
another in a business relationship. In spite of Gillie's
faults&mdash;nay, vices&mdash;he, Tropenell, now often found
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
himself favourably comparing Laura's brother with
Laura's husband.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell was acutely, intolerably, jealous
of Godfrey Pavely&mdash;jealous in the burning, scorching
sense which is so often the terrible concomitant of such
a passion as that which now possessed him. Godfrey
Pavely's presence in his own house, his slightly tyrannical,
often possessive attitude to Laura, the perpetual
reminder that he was, after all, the father of the child
Laura had borne, and who seemed to fill her heart to
the exclusion of all else&mdash;all this was for this man
who loved her an ever-recurring ordeal which might
well have satisfied the sternest moralist.</p>

<p class="indent">That night Oliver Tropenell dreamt of Laura. He
thought that he was pursuing her through a maze of
flowering shrubs and trees. She was fleeing from him,
yet now and again she would turn, and beckon....</p>

<p class="indent">His first waking thought was that they would meet
to-night&mdash;here, in his mother's house. But before
that happened a long day would have to be lived
through, for he had made up his mind not to go to
The Chase till Laura again asked him to do so.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="cap">THE door of Mrs. Tropenell's long low drawing-room
opened very quietly, and Laura Pavely
came through into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">She had left a brightly lighted hall for a room of
which the only present illumination radiated from a
shaded reading lamp standing on a little table behind
which sat her hostess. Thus, for perhaps as long as
half a minute, Laura thought herself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">During that half minute Mrs. Tropenell, with eyes
well accustomed to the shaded light, gazed at her visitor
with an eager, searching look, the look of one who
wishes to see more, and to see further, than she has
ever seen before.</p>

<p class="indent">But what she saw&mdash;all she saw&mdash;was the Laura she
knew with a knowledge that was at once so superficially
close, and so little intimate. A woman whose
stillness of manner&mdash;a manner which at times made
her appear almost inanimate&mdash;covered, as Mrs. Tropenell
had secret reason to know, an extraordinary force
of negative will power. It was a force which had even
pierced Godfrey Pavely's complacency, and shattered
his firm belief in all the rights that English law bestows
on the man who has the good or ill fortune to
be a husband.</p>

<p class="indent">As Laura advanced into the room her hostess saw
that her visitor's beautifully shaped head, set proudly
and freely on the slender shoulders, was thrown back
in a characteristic gesture of attention, and, with a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
touch of reluctance, she admired afresh the masses of
fair, <i>cendr</i> hair drawn back from the forehead in a
way which to most women would have been trying,
yet which to this woman lent an air of eighteenth-century
charm and distinction.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no colour in Laura Pavely's face, but her
eyes, heavy-lidded, and fringed with eyelashes darker
than her hair, were deeply blue.</p>

<p class="indent">To-night she was wearing a very simple evening
dress, a white chiffon tea-gown with a long black lace
coat. The under dress was almost high to the throat,
but beneath the black lace the wearer's arms, soft, dimpled,
and rounded, were bare to the shoulder, and
gleamed palely, revealingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell wondered whether Laura knew that
her arms were unusually lovely; then, for she was a
very honest woman, her conscience rebuked her.
Laura's faults with regard to men were faults of
omission, not of commission. Of course she was
aware&mdash;she could not help being aware&mdash;that she was
a singularly attractive and distinguished-looking creature.
But she had always taken her own beauty, her
own distinction, just as she did the rare, distinctive
features of her garden, and the perhaps over-studied
charm of her house&mdash;as something to be tended and
kept beautiful, but also to be guarded from alien indifferent
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps because in these days every intelligent
woman claims to be picturesque and witty&mdash;beauty,
sheer beauty, is somewhat under the weather. Laura
Pavely, to use the current jargon of her day, was not
a "success." She was thought to be affected, "deep,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
prudish, whereas she was simply indifferent to the
more commonplace human elements about her.</p>

<p class="indent">Her marriage had withdrawn her from the circle
of the old friends and neighbours among whom she
had been brought up, in a measure because none of
them could "do," excepting in a very casual and cursory
sense, with Godfrey Pavely. The world of his
youth, the little world in and about the country town
of Pewsbury, to which he had introduced her as a
bride with such exultant complacency, found her not
only disagreeably superior, but also dull. Besides, during
the early days of her marriage she had been too
bewildered by the conditions of her new life, and of
her relationship with her husband, to trouble about
making new friends, or even new acquaintances.</p>

<p class="indent">And so it was that in any intimate sense Mrs. Tropenell
was still Laura's only close friend, but the younger
woman was rather pathetically aware of how little she
really possessed of the older woman's heart, how constantly
she was compared, and ever to her detriment,
to her dead mother, even how unconscious a rival in
the older woman's favour was Laura's own child&mdash;merry,
cheerful, loving little Alice.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Aunt Letty? I didn't see you were there."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura Pavely had a delightful voice&mdash;low, clear,
vibrating. It was a voice which sometimes seemed
to promise more depth of feeling than its owner ever
chose to betray.</p>

<p class="indent">As she stooped to kiss Mrs. Tropenell, Laura let
herself slide down on to the floor. She knelt there for
a moment, and the light gleamed on her fair hair and
upturned face. "Alice sent you her love," she said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
softly, "heaps of love. She's better to-night, though
not quite well yet!" And then, as there came a sound
of quick footsteps across the hall, she rose, and drew
herself up to her full height, with the grace of movement
and the absence of flurry which were both so
characteristic of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell looked up quickly. Had Laura
flushed, as she sometimes did flush, with a deep, unbecoming
reddening of her pale face, when moved or
startled? No, she seemed, if anything, paler, more
impassive than usual, and Oliver's mother asked herself,
yet again, what of late she had so often asked
herself&mdash;if Laura was capable of <i>any</i> feeling, <i>any</i>
passion, save a feeling of horror, a passion of repugnance,
for aught which seemed to smirch her own fastidious
physical and spiritual entity.</p>

<p class="indent">That she loved her child, the high-spirited, happy-natured
little girl, whose presence alone made life
sweet and normal at Lawford Chase, Mrs. Tropenell
could not doubt&mdash;she had had proof of how deeply
Laura loved her child on the only occasion danger
had come near to Alice&mdash;during a bout of some childish
ailment, when for a few hours the little creature
had been in danger of death. She, the older woman,
had been frightened, awed, by Laura's terrible, dry-eyed
agony....</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell opened the door, and as he walked
across the room, his mother's heart quivered with
jealous pain, and even with a feeling of secret, impotent
anger, as she saw the eager, rapt look which
lighted up his dark face.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura held out her ringless right hand, but he only
just touched it. "I'm sorry I'm late!" he exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
"As a matter of fact I was reading a letter just come,
by the second post, from Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've written to Gillie to-day," Laura said quietly.
It seemed such a long, long time since yesterday morning.
She felt as if the extraordinary thing which had
happened then had been blotted out.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you sent your letter off?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not yet," she was surprised at the question.</p>

<p class="indent">And then there fell a curious silence on those three
people, till at last the door opened, and dinner was
announced.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver! Take in Laura," said Mrs. Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">On the last occasion when the three had dined alone
together there had been a little smiling discussion as
to the order in which they should go into the dining-room.
But that had been many weeks ago. They
were not in such a light mood to-night, and yet&mdash;and
yet, why should they not be? The hostess knew of
no reason.</p>

<p class="indent">The two paired off together, and Oliver's mother
asked herself, for perhaps the thousandth time in the
last three months, why she had allowed this&mdash;this
friendship between her son and Laura Pavely to come
about? It would have been so easy to arrange that
she and her son should spend the summer abroad!
When he had first come home there had been a talk
of their going away together to Italy, or to France&mdash;France,
which they had both loved when he was a
clever, ardent, headstrong boy, with a strength of
brain and originality of mind too big for his boyish
boots.</p>

<p class="indent">But the harm, what harm there was&mdash;sometimes she
hoped it was not so very much harm after all&mdash;had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
been done quickly. By the end of that first month at
home, Oliver had lost all wish to leave Freshley.</p>

<p class="indent">In those early days&mdash;or was it that already he was
being unconsciously hypocritical as men are wont to
be when in such case as that in which he now found
himself?&mdash;he had seemed to have formed an even
closer friendship with Godfrey Pavely than with Godfrey
Pavely's wife. They had even made a joint business
expedition to town together, Godfrey as Oliver's
guest, staying in one of those luxurious hotels which
seem equally attractive to the millionaire and the adventurer.
But Oliver had at last thrown off, when
alone with his mother, any pretence of liking, far
less of respecting, Godfrey Pavely. Yet when with
the other man he still kept up the sinister fiction. She
knew that.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The three sat down in the pretty, octagon-shaped
dining-room, and the mother and son talked, Laura
saying very little, and never giving, always accepting&mdash;in
that sense, perhaps, an elemental woman after
all! Even so, she showed, when she did rouse herself
to express an opinion, that there was a good deal of
thought and of intelligence in her small, beautiful
head.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell, sitting at the top of the oval table,
told herself that in a primeval sense such a woman
as Laura might well be the complement of such a man
as was Oliver. He had strength, passion, idealism,
enough to furnish forth half a dozen ordinary human
beings. And he had patience too&mdash;patience which is
but another name for that self-control in the secret
things of passion which often brings men's desires to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
fruition. It was patience and self-control which had
been so lacking in Godfrey Pavely during those early
days when Laura had at least desired to fulfil her duty
as a wife.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet again and again during that uncomfortable
half-hour Mrs. Tropenell caught herself wishing that
Godfrey Pavely was there, sitting on her right hand.
Godfrey always had plenty to say for himself, especially
in that house, and when he felt secure of the
discretion of those about him, he would often tell
much that he ought, in his character of banker, to
have left unsaid. He knew the private business of
every one, gentle or simple, for miles round, and took
an easy, unaffected interest in it all. It was only
when he touched on wider matters, especially on politics,
that he grew unbearably tedious and prosy. But
then the only person whom Mrs. Tropenell ever listened
to with pleasure on such subjects was her old
friend, Lord St. Amant, who always knew what he
was talking about, and always salted what he knew
with happy flashes of wit and humour.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver accompanied the two ladies back into the
drawing-room, and his mother did not know whether
to be glad or sorry that she had not had a few minutes
alone with the younger woman. Sometimes it
seemed as if she and Laura never were alone together
now. Was it possible that of late Laura was deliberately
avoiding her? As this half suspicion came into
Mrs. Tropenell's mind she looked up and saw her
son's eyes fixed on her face.</p>

<p class="indent">There was something imperious, imploring, commanding,
in the look he bent on her. She saw that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
he was willing her to go away&mdash;to leave him, alone,
with Laura....</p>

<p class="indent">Under the spell of that look she got up. "I must go
upstairs for my work," she said quietly. "And I
have a letter to write too. I shan't be very long."</p>

<p class="indent">It was as if Oliver made but one swift step to the
door, and, as he held it open, his mother turned her
head away, lest he should see that tears had come into
her eyes&mdash;tears of pain, and yes, of fear.</p>

<p class="indent">How was all this to end?</p>

<p class="indent">After walking slowly forward into the square
brightly lighted hall she suddenly stayed her steps,
and clasped her hands together.</p>

<p class="indent">A terrible temptation&mdash;terrible, almost unbelievable
to such a woman as was Letitia Tropenell&mdash;held her
in its grip. She longed with a fearful, gasping longing,
to go back and listen at the door which had just
closed behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">So strong was this temptation that she actually
visualised herself walking across to a certain corner,
turning down the electric light switch, then, in the
darkness, creeping to the drawing-room door, and
there gently, gently&mdash;pushing it open, say half an
inch, in order to hear what those two were now saying,
the one to the other....</p>

<p class="indent">At last, thrusting the temptation from her, she
again began walking across the brightly lighted hall,
and so, slowly, made her way up the staircase which
led to her bedroom.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">What Mrs. Tropenell would have heard, had she
yielded to that ignoble temptation, would not have told
her anything of what she had so longed to know.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
After he had shut the door on his mother, Oliver
Tropenell walked back to the place where he had
stood a moment ago. But he did not come any nearer
than he had been before to his guest, and his manner
remained exactly what it had been when they had
been three, instead of being, as they were now, two, in
that dimly lighted room.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, both he and Laura, in their secret, hidden
selves, were profoundly conscious that Mrs. Tropenell's
absence made a great, if an intangible, difference.
It was the first time they had been alone that
day, for it was the first day for many weeks past that
Oliver had not walked over to The Chase, either in
the morning or in the afternoon or, as was almost
always the case, both after breakfast and about teatime.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, when the silence had become almost oppressive,
he spoke, with a certain hard directness in his
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the letter I received from Gillie to-day he tells
me that he can easily be spared for a few weeks, and
I've already telephoned a cable telling him to start at
once. I've said that if he thinks it advisable I myself
will leave for Mexico as soon as I hear from him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but I don't want you to do that!" Laura
Pavely looked up at him dismayed. "I thought you
meant to stay in England right up to Christmas?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, so I did, and I feel almost certain that he
won't think it necessary for me to go back. But the
important thing is Gillie's and your holiday. Why
shouldn't he take you and Alice to France or Italy
for a month?"</p>

<p class="indent">He saw her face, the face in which there had been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
a certain rigid, suffering gravity, light up, soften, and
then become overcast again. Moving a little nearer to
the low chair on which she was sitting&mdash;"Yes?" he
asked, looking down at her. "What is it you wish
to say, Laura?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Only that Godfrey would never let me go away
with Gillie." She spoke in a sad, low voice, but she
felt far more at her ease than she had yet felt this
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">The last time she and Oliver had been alone, they
had parted as enemies, but now there was nothing to
show that he remembered their interchange of bitter,
passionate words.</p>

<p class="indent">He answered quietly,</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder why you feel so sure of that? I believe
that if it were put to Godfrey in a reasonable way,
he could not possibly object to your going abroad with
your brother. It's time they made up that foolish old
quarrel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, if only I could get away with Gillie and my
little Alice!"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura looked up as she spoke, and Oliver Tropenell
was moved, almost unbearably so, by the look which
came over her face. Was it the mention of her child,
of her brother, or the thought of getting away from
Godfrey for a while, which so illumined her lovely,
shadowed eyes?</p>

<p class="indent">He went on, still speaking in the quiet, measured
tones which made her feel as if the scene of yesterday
had been an evil dream. "I've even thought of suggesting
that Godfrey should come out with me to Mexico,
while your little jaunt with Gillie takes place. We
could all be back here by Christmas!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
She shook her head. "I'm afraid Godfrey would
never go away except in what he considers his regular
holiday time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not even if I made it worth his while?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up, perplexed. And then a wave of hot
colour flamed up in her face. Her conscience, in
some ways a very delicate and scrupulous conscience,
smote her.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it her fault that Oliver Tropenell had come
so to despise Godfrey?</p>

<p class="indent">But he went on, speaking more naturally, that is
quickly, eagerly&mdash;more like his pre-yesterday self,
"No, I'm not joking! I think I can put Godfrey in
the way of doing some really good business out there.
We've spoken of it more than once&mdash;only yesterday
afternoon we spoke of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't mean with Gillie there?" There was
a note of incredulity in Laura's voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"No." They were on dangerous ground now. "Not
exactly with Gillie there&mdash;though it seems to me,
Laura, that Godfrey ought to make it up with Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly, musingly, as if speaking to herself, she said,
"If Godfrey ever goes to Mexico I think he would
want me to come too&mdash;he always does." And this was
true, for Godfrey Pavely in some ways was curiously
uxorious. Little as they were to one another, Laura's
husband never allowed her to go away by herself, or
even with her child, for more than a very few days.</p>

<p class="indent">"You come too&mdash;to Mexico?" There was surprise,
doubt, in Oliver Tropenell's voice, and suddenly Laura
did a strange thing, imprudent, uncalled-for in the
circumstances in which she found herself with this
man; yet she did it with no trace of what is ordinarily
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
called coquetry. Lifting up her head, she said rather
plaintively, "Surely you wouldn't mind my coming
too, Oliver?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Does that mean that you've forgiven me?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">She got up from the low chair where she had been
sitting, and, facing him, exclaimed impulsively, "I
want us both to forget what happened yesterday! I
was wrong, very wrong, in saying what I did about
Godfrey," her voice faltered, and slowly she added,
"But with you, who seemed to somehow understand
everything without being told, I felt, I felt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He raised a warning hand, for his ears had caught
the sound of light footfalls in the hall. "Mother's
coming back," he said abruptly. "Don't say anything
to her of my cable to Gillie." And at once, without
any change in his voice, he went on: "There's a great
deal that would interest you, quite as much as Godfrey,
out there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and he turned round quickly.
"I'm trying to persuade Laura to come out to Mexico,"
he exclaimed. "Godfrey has practically promised to
pay me a visit, and I don't see why she shouldn't come
too!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell made no answer. She knew, and
she believed that both the people standing there knew
as well as she did, that such an expedition could never
take place so long as Gilbert Baynton was Oliver's
partner. Baynton and Pavely were bitter enemies.
There had never been even the semblance of a reconciliation
between them.</p>

<p class="indent">But as her son bent his eyes on her as if demanding
an answer, she forced herself to say lightly: "I expect
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
they both will, some day, and while they are away
I can have my dear little Alice!"</p>

<p class="indent">When, a little later, Mrs. Tropenell accompanied
Laura out into the hall, she said, "Do come in to-morrow
or Sunday, my dear. I seem to see so little of
you now."</p>

<p class="indent">"I will&mdash;I will!" and as she kissed the older woman,
Laura murmured, "You're so good to me, Aunty Letty&mdash;you've
always been so very, very good to me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver opened wide the door giving into the garden.
He was now obviously impatient to get Laura
once more alone to himself....</p>

<p class="indent">After she went back to her drawing-room, Mrs. Tropenell
walked straight across to a window, and
there, holding back the heavy curtain, she watched
the two figures moving in the bright moonlight across
the lawn, towards the beech avenue which would presently
engulf them.</p>

<p class="indent">What were their real relations the one to the other?
Was Laura as blind to the truth as she seemed to
be, or was she shamming&mdash;as women, God or the devil
helping them&mdash;so often sham?</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly, feeling as if she had suddenly become
very, very old, Mrs. Tropenell dropped the curtain,
and walking back to her usual place, her usual chair,
took up her knitting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="cap">LAURA and Oliver Tropenell walked across the
grass in silence, and still in silence they passed
through under the great dark arch formed by the
beech trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was extraordinarily moved and excited. Her
brother, her dear, dear Gillie, coming home? She
had taken the surprising news very quietly, but it had
stirred her to the depths of her nature. Without even
telling her of what he was going to do, the man now
walking by her side had brought about the thing
that for years she had longed should come to pass.</p>

<p class="indent">In her husband Laura had become accustomed to
a man who was cautious and deliberate to a fault,
and who, as so often happens, carried this peculiarity
even more into the affairs of his daily life than into
his business. Often weeks would go by before Godfrey
would make up his mind to carry out some small,
necessary improvement connected with the estate.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet here was Oliver, who, without saying a word
to her about it, had decided that Gillie should come to
England just to see the sister he had not seen for
seven years! Laura began to think it possible that
after all Godfrey <i>would</i> make it up with her brother.
Oliver Tropenell had an extraordinary influence over
Godfrey Pavely; again and again, as regarded small
matters, he had, as it were, made Godfrey's mind up
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">A feeling of deep gratitude welled up in her heart
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
for the silent man by her side. She longed for him
to speak now, as he had spoken to her, kindly, conciliatingly,
but a few minutes ago, in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">But Oliver stalked along dumbly in the intense darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly she remembered, with a miserable
feeling of discomfort, and yes, of shame, that she
could hardly expect him to be as usual. And so it was
she who, making a great effort, at last broke the unnatural
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've never thanked you for your letter," she said
nervously. "But I'm very much obliged to you, Oliver,
for consenting to be my trustee. And I know that
Godfrey will be! I hope it won't give you much trouble&mdash;the
trusteeship, I mean. I know that Mr. Blackmore,
for years past, left it all to Godfrey."</p>

<p class="indent">He answered slowly, meditatively, and to her intense
relief, quite in his old way. "Yes, I think Godfrey
will be pleased. To tell you the truth, Laura, I
thought I would take advantage of his pleasure to
suggest that plan about Gillie&mdash;I mean that you and
Gillie and Alice should all go abroad together."</p>

<p class="indent">"If only you can persuade Godfrey to let me have
Gillie here for a while, I shall be more than content!"
She spoke with a rather piteous eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">They were walking very, very slowly. Oliver had
now turned on his electric torch, and it threw a bright
patch of light on the path immediately before them,
making all the darkness about them the blacker and
the more intense.</p>

<p class="indent">In a hard voice he exclaimed: "Of course Gillie
must come here, and stay here! His being anywhere
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
else would be preposterous&mdash;&mdash;" And then, once
more, he fell into that strange, disconcerting silence.</p>

<p class="indent">The last time they two had walked down under the
beeches at night had been some three weeks ago.
Laura and Godfrey had dined with the Tropenells, and
then Godfrey had said that he had to go home and
do some work, leaving her to stay on, for nearly an
hour, with the mother and son.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver's torch had gone out that evening, and he
had suggested, a little diffidently, that Laura should
take his arm; smiling, she had laid the tips of her
fingers lightly on his sleeve. She had felt so happy
then, so happy, and absolutely at her ease, with her
companion....</p>

<p class="indent">Tears welled up in her eyes. She was grateful for
the darkness, but her trembling voice betrayed her as
she exclaimed, "Oliver? I do again ask you to forget
what happened yesterday, and to forgive me for the
things I said. I'm very sorry that I spoke as I did."</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped walking, and put out his torch. "Don't
be sorry," he said, in a low, constrained voice. "It's
far better that I should know exactly how you feel.
Of course I was surprised, for I'd always had a notion
that women regarded love from a more ideal standpoint
than men seem able to do. But I see now that
I was mistaken." Some of the bitterness with which
his heart was still full and overflowing crept into his
measured voice. "I think you will believe me when
I say that I did not mean to insult you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He was going on, but she interrupted him.</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;sorry and ashamed too, Oliver,
of what I said. Please&mdash;please forget what happened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
He turned on her amid the dark shadows.</p>

<p class="indent">"If <i>I</i> forget, will <i>you</i>?" he asked sombrely.</p>

<p class="indent">And she answered, "Yes, yes&mdash;indeed I will! But
before we put what happened yesterday behind us forever,
do let me tell you, Oliver, that I <i>am</i> grateful,
deeply grateful, for your&mdash;&mdash;" she hesitated painfully,
and then murmured "your affection."</p>

<p class="indent">But Oliver Tropenell did not meet her half-way,
as she had perhaps thought he would. He was torn
by conflicting feelings, cursing himself for having lost
his self-control the day before, and yet, even so,
deep in his subtle, storm-tossed mind, not altogether
sorry for what had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">And so it was she who went on, speaking slowly
and with difficulty: "I know that I have been to
blame! I know that I ought never to have spoken of
Godfrey as I have sometimes allowed myself to do
to you. According to his lights, he is a good husband,
and I know that I have been&mdash;that I am&mdash;a bitter
disappointment to him."</p>

<p class="indent">He muttered something&mdash;she did not hear what it
was, and she hurried on: "What I have wanted&mdash;and
oh, Oliver, I have wanted it so much&mdash;is a friend,"
almost he heard the unspoken words, "not a lover."</p>

<p class="indent">She put out her hand in the darkness and laid it,
for a moment, on his arm. And then, suddenly, in
that moment of, to him, exquisite, unhoped-for contact,
Oliver Tropenell swore to himself most solemnly
that he would rest satisfied with what she would, and
could, grant him. And so&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that," he said in measured, restrained tones.
"And I have made up my mind to be that friend,
Laura. We will both forget what happened yesterday.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
If you are ashamed, I am a hundred times more
so! And do believe me when I tell you that
what you said about Godfrey&mdash;why, I've forgotten
it already&mdash;had nothing to do with my outburst. I'm
a lonely man, my dear, and somehow, without in the
least meaning it, I know, you crept into my heart and
filled it all. But already, since yesterday, I've come
to a more reasonable frame of mind."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment, despising himself for uttering
such lying words, and then he went on, this time
honestly meaning what he said: "Henceforth, Laura,
I swear that I'll never again say a word to you that
all the world might not hear. I never did, till yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know, I know," she said hurriedly. "And that
was why I was so surprised."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let's put it all behind us and go back to 'as we
were'!" He was speaking now with a sort of gruff,
good-humoured decision, and Laura sighed, relieved,
and yet&mdash;so unreasonable a being is woman&mdash;unsatisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">The light from his torch flashed again, and they
walked on, under the dark arch of leaves and branches,
till they were close to the open road.</p>

<p class="indent">And there Laura said, "I wish you would leave
me here, Oliver. I feel sure that Aunt Letty is waiting
up for you."</p>

<p class="indent">He answered her at once. "It won't make more
than five minutes' difference. I'll only walk as far
as the lodge. It's a lonely little stretch of road."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lonely?" she repeated. "Why, there isn't a bit
of it that isn't within hail of Rosedean!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then, determined to go back to their old easy
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
companionship, that companionship which had lately
become so easy and so intimate that when with him
she had often spoken a passing thought aloud, "Katty
came home to-day. I must try and see her to-morrow.
She's a plucky creature, Oliver! I wish that
Aunt Letty liked her better than she does."</p>

<p class="indent">He answered idly, "There's nothing much either
to like or dislike in Mrs. Winslow&mdash;at least so it always
seems to me."</p>

<p class="indent">But she answered quickly, defensively, "There's a
great deal to like in her&mdash;when I think of Katty Winslow
I feel ashamed of myself. I've known her do
such kind things! And then she's so good about Godfrey&mdash;I
don't know what Godfrey would do without
her. They knew each other as children. It's as if she
was his sister. All that little Pewsbury world which
bores me so, is full of interest to them both. I'm always
glad when she's at Rosedean. I only wish she
didn't go away so often&mdash;Godfrey does miss her so!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I know he does," he said drily.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked on in silence till they were close to
the low lodge.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura Pavely held out her hand, and Oliver Tropenell
took it in his cool, firm grasp for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-night," he said. "I suppose we shall meet
some time to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="indent">She answered eagerly. "Yes, do come in, any time!
Alice and I shall be gardening before lunch. Godfrey
won't be back till late, for he's sure to go straight to
the Bank from the station. He'll be so much obliged
to you about that trusteeship, Oliver. It's really very
good of you to take so much trouble."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell answered slowly, "Yes, I think
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
Godfrey will be pleased; and as I've already told you,
I'll certainly take advantage of his pleasure, Laura,
to suggest the plan about Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">Once more she exclaimed: "If only you can persuade
Godfrey to let me have Gillie at The Chase
for a while, I shall be more than content!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a thrill of excitement, of longing, in
her low voice, as, without waiting for an answer, she
walked away, leaving him looking after her. The
patch of whiteness formed by the hem of her gown
moved swiftly along&mdash;against the moonlit background
of grass, trees, and sky. He stood and watched the
moving, fluttering bit of whiteness till it vanished in
the grey silvery haze. Then, slowly, he turned on his
heel and made his way back home.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was nearly a quarter of a mile from the lodge
to The Chase, as the house was always called, but there
was a rather shorter way across the grass, through
trees; and Laura, when she came to where she knew
the little path to be, left the carriage way, and stepped
up on to the grass.</p>

<p class="indent">She felt oppressed, her soul filled with a piteous lassitude
and weariness of life, in spite of the coming
return home of her only brother. She had been moved
and excited, as well as made acutely unhappy, by
what had happened yesterday morning. Mrs. Tropenell,
as almost always happens in such a case, was not
fair to Laura Pavely. Laura had been overwhelmed
with surprise&mdash;a surprise in which humiliation and
self-rebuke were intolerably mingled&mdash;and yes, a certain
proud anger.</p>

<p class="indent">The words Oliver had said, and alas! that it should
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
be so, the bitter, scornful words she had uttered in
reply, had, she felt, degraded them both&mdash;she far, far
more than him. At the time she had been too deeply
hurt, too instinctively anxious to punish him, to
measure her words. And now she told herself that
she had spoken yesterday in a way no man would ever
forget, and few, very few men would ever forgive.
Though he had been kind to-night&mdash;very, very kind&mdash;his
manner had altered, all the happy ease had gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Tears came into Laura Pavely's eyes; they rolled
down her cheeks. Suddenly she found herself sobbing
bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped walking, and covered her face with
her hands. With a depth of pain, unplumbed till now,
she told herself that she would never, never be able to
make Oliver understand why she had said those cruel
stinging words. Without a disloyalty to Godfrey of
which she was incapable, she could not hope to make
him understand why she had so profound a distaste,
ay, and contempt, for that which, if he had spoken
truly yesterday, he thought the greatest thing in the
world. With sad, leaden-weighted conviction she realised
that there must always be between a man and a
woman, however great their friendship and mutual
confidence, certain barriers that nothing can force or
clear.</p>

<p class="indent">She had believed, though as a matter of fact she
had not thought very much about it, that Oliver Tropenell,
in some mysterious way, was unlike ordinary
men. As far as she knew, he had never "fallen in
love." Women, who, as she could not help knowing,
had always played so great a part in her brother Gillie's
life, seemed not to exist&mdash;so far as Oliver Tropenell
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
was concerned. He had never even seemed attracted,
as almost every man was, by pretty Katty Winslow,
the innocent <i>divorce</i> now living at his very gates.
So she, Laura, had allowed herself to slip into a close,
intimate relationship which, all unknowingly to her,
had proved most dangerous to him....</p>

<p class="indent">Still crying bitterly, she told herself that she had
been too happy all this summer. Godfrey had been
kinder, less, less&mdash;she shrank from putting it into
words&mdash;but yes, less ill-tempered, mean, and tiresome
than usual. Oliver had had such a good effect on
Godfrey, and she had honestly believed that the two
were friends.</p>

<p class="indent">But how could they be friends if&mdash;if it was true
that Oliver loved her? Laura Pavely knew nothing
of the well-worn byways of our poor human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she threw her head back and saw the
starlit sky above her. Somehow that wonderful ever-recurring
miracle of impersonal, unearthly beauty
calmed and comforted her. Drying her eyes, she
told herself that something after all had survived out
of yesterday's wreck. Her friend might be a man&mdash;a
man as other men were; but he was noble, and singularly
selfless, for all that. On the evening of the
very day on which she had grievously offended and
wounded him, he had written her a kindly letter, offering
to be her trustee.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been moments to-day when she had
thought of writing Mrs. Tropenell a note to say she
did not feel well&mdash;and that she would not dine at
Freshley that night. But oh, how glad she was now
that a mixture of pride and feminine delicacy had
prompted her to behave just as if nothing had happened,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
as if words which could never be forgotten had
not been uttered between herself and Oliver! She
had thought he would punish her this evening by being
sulky and disagreeable&mdash;that was her husband's
invariable method of showing displeasure. But with
the exception of a word or two uttered very quietly,
and more as if she, rather than he, had something to
forgive, he had behaved as if yesterday had never
been. He had heaped coals of fire upon her head,
making it plain that even now he was only thinking
of her&mdash;of her and of Gillie, of how he could pleasure
them both by securing her a holiday with her only
brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Every word of that restrained, not very natural,
conversation held just now under the beech trees re-echoed
in her ears. She seemed to hear again the
slowly uttered, measured words, "I am going to be
your friend, Laura"....</p>

<p class="indent">And then there came over Laura Pavely an extraordinary
sensation of moral and mental disturbance.
Once more everything which had happened to-day
was blotted out, and she went back to yesterday morning.
Again she lived through those moments during
which Oliver Tropenell had offered her what was to
him the greatest thing man has it in him to bestow&mdash;love,
even if illicit, unsanctified. And she had rejected
the gift with a passion of scorn, spurning it as
she would have done a base and unclean thing.</p>

<p class="indent">Years and years ago, in her quiet, shadowed youth,
she too had believed love to be the most precious,
beautiful thing in life. Then, with marriage to Godfrey
Pavely had come the conviction that love was
not beautiful, but very, very ugly&mdash;at its best one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
of those dubious gifts to man by which old Dame Nature
works out certain cunning designs of her own.
And yet, when something of what she believed to be
the truth had been uttered by her during that terrible
tense exchange of words, she had seen how she, in
her turn, had shocked, and even repelled, Oliver Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more sobs welled up from her throat, once
more she covered her face with her hands....</p>

<p class="indent">At last, feeling worn out with the violence of an
emotion which, unknown to her, vivified her whole
being, she walked on till the fine Tudor front of the
old house which was at once so little and so much
her home, rose before her. It was an infinite comfort
to know that Godfrey would not be there waiting
for her, and that she would be able to make her way
up alone through the sleeping house to the room which
opened into her child's nursery.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="cap">MRS. TROPENELL, waiting for Oliver to come
back, lost count of time, and yet not much more
than half an hour had gone by before she heard the
sound of a glazed door, which opened on to the
garden from a distant part of the house, burst open.</p>

<p class="indent">In that sound she seemed to hear all the impatience,
all the pain, all the frustrated longing she divined in
her son.</p>

<p class="indent">She got up from her chair and stood listening.
Would he go straight upstairs&mdash;as she, in her stormy,
passionate youth, would have done in his place?</p>

<p class="indent">But no&mdash;with a feeling of rushing, unreasoning joy
she heard him coming across the hall. A moment later
he walked through into the room and came and stood
before her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother," he said, "it's a beautiful night. Would
you care to come into the garden for a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as they had stepped out of the French
window into the darkness, she took his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't feel it cold?" he asked solicitously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh no," she said, surprised. "I'm so little cold,
Oliver, that I shouldn't at all mind going over to the
blue bench, and sitting down."</p>

<p class="indent">They went across the grass, to a curious painted
Italian bench which had been a gift of the woman who
was so much in both their thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">And there, "I want to ask you a question," he said
slowly. "What led to the marriage of Laura Baynton
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
and Godfrey Pavely? From something she once said
to me, I gather she thinks that you approved of it."</p>

<p class="indent">She felt as if his eyes were burning her in the darkness,
and as she hesitated, hardly knowing what to
say, he went on, and in his voice there was something
terribly accusing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did <i>you</i> make the marriage, mother? Did you
really advise her to take that fellow?"</p>

<p class="indent">The questions stung her. "No," she answered
coldly. "I did nothing of the kind, Oliver. If you
wish to know the truth, the person who was most to
blame was your friend Gillie, Laura's brother. Laura
adored her brother. There was nothing in the world
she wouldn't have done for him, and she married
Godfrey&mdash;it seems a strange thing to look back on
now&mdash;to please Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">"But she met Pavely here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course she did. As you know, she very
often stayed with me after her father died, and when
Gillie Baynton, instead of making a home for her,
was getting into scrape after scrape, spending her
money as well as his own."</p>

<p class="indent">He muttered, "Gillie knew she was to have money
later."</p>

<p class="indent">She went on: "And then Godfrey Pavely in love
is a very different person from Godfrey Pavely&mdash;well,
out of love. He was set on marrying Laura, and
that over years. He first asked her when she was
seventeen, and they married when she was twenty-one.
In the interval he had done Gillie many good turns.
In fact Godfrey bought Laura from Gillie. That,
Oliver, is the simple truth."</p>

<p class="indent">She waited for him to make some kind of comment,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
but he said nothing, and she went on, a tinge of deep,
yearning sadness in her voice, "Don't let your friends,
or rather their incompatibility of temper&mdash;" she hesitated,
and then rather solemnly ended her sentence
with the words, "affect <i>our</i> relations, my son."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry, mother." Tropenell's voice altered,
softened. "Forgive me for the way I spoke just now!
I had got it into my head&mdash;I didn't know quite exactly
why&mdash;that you had promoted the marriage. I
see now that you really had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't say that! It's difficult to remember exactly
what did happen. Godfrey never wearied in his
slow, inexorable pursuit of Laura. I think that at
last she was touched by his constancy. She knew
nothing then of human nature&mdash;she knows nothing
of it now."</p>

<p class="indent">He muttered, "Poor girl! Poor unfortunate girl!"
and his way of uttering the commonplace words hurt
his mother shrewdly.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she made up her mind to say at least one
true thing to him. It was a thing she knew well no
one but herself would ever say to Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am in a position to know," she said, "and I
want you to believe it when I tell you, that if Laura
is to be as much pitied as you believe her to be&mdash;so
too, I tell you, Oliver, is Godfrey! If I had known
before the marriage, even an hour before the actual
wedding, what I learnt afterwards&mdash;I mean as to their
amazingly different ideals of life&mdash;I would have done
<i>anything</i> to stop it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What d'you mean exactly, mother, by different
ideals of life?"</p>

<p class="indent">As he asked the question he moved away from her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
a little, but he turned round and bent his eyes on to
her face&mdash;dimly, whitely, apparent in the starlit, moonlit
night.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not speak at once. It seemed to her that
the question answered itself, and yet she felt that he
was quivering with impatience for her answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"The French," she said in a low voice, "have a
very good phrase to describe the kind of man Godfrey
is. Godfrey Pavely is a <i>le moyen homme sensuel</i>&mdash;the
typical man of his kind and class, Oliver&mdash;the self-satisfied,
stolid, unimaginative upper middle-class.
Such men feel that the world, their English world at
any rate, has been made for them, built up by the all-powerful
entity they call God in their personal interest.
They know scarcely anything of what is going
on, either above or below them, and what is more, they
do not really care, as long as they and their like prosper."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver nodded impatiently. He knew all that well
enough!</p>

<p class="indent">His mother went on: "Godfrey Pavely ought to
have married some rather clever, rather vulgar-natured,
rather pretty girl, belonging to his own little
world of Pewsbury. Then, instead of being what he
now is, an uncomfortable, not over contented man,
he would have been, well&mdash;what his worthy father
was before him. That odd interest in queer, speculative
money dealings, is the unfortunate fellow's only
outlet, Oliver, for what romance is in him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder if you're right, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sure I am."</p>

<p class="indent">There came a long silence between them.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell could see her son in outline, as it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
were, his well-shaped head, and long, lean, finely proportioned
body. He was sitting at the further end of
the bench, and he was now staring right before him.
She found it easier&mdash;far easier&mdash;to speak of Godfrey
than of Laura. And so, musingly, she went on:</p>

<p class="indent">"Looking back a dozen years, I can think of several
young women whom Godfrey would have done well
to consider&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can certainly think of one, mother," he said, and
in the darkness there came a bitter little smile over his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean Katty Winslow? Yes&mdash;I think you're
right, my dear. When Godfrey turned from Katty to
Laura, he made a terrible mistake. Katty, in the old
days, had very much the same ambitions, and the same
social aspirations, as himself. She was really fond of
him too! She would have become&mdash;what's the odious
word?&mdash;'smart.' And Godfrey would have been
proud of her. By now he would have stood for Parliament,
and then, in due course, would have come a
baronetcy. Yes, if the gods had been kind, Godfrey
Pavely would have married poor little Katty&mdash;he
didn't behave over well to her, you know!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It seems to me that Mrs. Winslow has made quite
a good thing of her life, mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you really think that, Oliver?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I do. She managed very cleverly, so I'm told,
to get rid of that worthless husband of hers, and now
she's got that pretty little house, and that charming
little garden, and as much of Godfrey as she seems
to want." He spoke with a kind of hard indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">"Katty's not the sort of woman to be really satisfied
with a pretty little house, a charming little garden,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
and a platonic share in another woman's husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then she'll marry again. People seem to think
her very attractive."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my dearest."</p>

<p class="indent">"To return to Laura&mdash;what should have been <i>her</i>
fate had the gods been kind?"</p>

<p class="indent">She left his question without an answer so dangerously
long as to create a strange feeling of excitement
and strain between them. Then, reluctantly, she answered
it. "Laura might have been happiest in not
marrying at all, and in any case she should have
married late. As to what kind of man would have
made her happy, of course I have a theory."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is your theory?" He leant towards her,
breathing rather quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think," she said hesitatingly, "that Laura
might have been happy with a man of the world, older
than herself, who would have regarded his wife as a
rare and beautiful possession. Such a man would
have understood the measure of what she was willing
and able to give&mdash;and to withhold. I can also
imagine Laura married to a young idealist, the kind
of man whose attitude to his wife is one of worship,
whose demands, if indeed they can be called demands,
are few, infrequent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell stopped abruptly. What she had
just said led to a path she did not mean to follow.
But she soon realised with dismay that she had said
too much, or too little.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean," said Oliver hoarsely, "that Pavely&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Pavely&mdash;&mdash;" he left his question unfinished, but
she knew he meant to exact an answer and she did not
keep him waiting long for it. Still she chose her
words very carefully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think that Godfrey Pavely, in the matter of his
relations to his wife, is a very unfortunate, and, some
would say, a very ill-used man, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell suddenly diminished the distance
between his mother and himself. The carefully chosen,
vague words she had just uttered had been like balm
poured into a festering and intolerably painful wound.</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor devil!" he said contemptuously, and there
was a rather terrible tone of triumph, as well as of
contempt, in the muttered exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell was startled and, what she seldom
was, frightened. She felt she was face to face with
an elemental force&mdash;the force of hate.</p>

<p class="indent">She repeated his last words, but in how different a
spirit, in how different a tone! "Poor devil? Yes,
Oliver, Godfrey is really to be pitied, and I ask you
to believe me, my son, when I say that he does do his
duty by Laura according to his lights."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother?" He put out his hand in the darkness
and just touched hers. "Why is it that Laura is so
much fonder of you than you are of Laura? You
don't respect&mdash;or even like&mdash;Godfrey?"</p>

<p class="indent">She protested eagerly. "But I <i>am</i> fond of Laura&mdash;very,
very fond, Oliver! But though, as you say, I
neither really like nor respect Godfrey, I can't help
being sorry for him. He once said to me&mdash;it's a long
time ago&mdash;'I thought I was marrying a woman, but
I've married a marble statue. I'm married to something
like <i>that</i>'&mdash;and he pointed to 'The Wingless
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
Victory' your father brought me, years ago, from
Italy. Godfrey is an unhappy man, Oliver&mdash;come,
admit that you know that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think she's far, far more unhappy than he is!
No man with so thoroughly good an opinion of himself
is ever <i>really</i> unhappy. Still, it's a frightful
tangle."</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped short for a moment, then in a very low
voice, he asked her, "Is there no way of cutting it
through, mother?" Suddenly he answered his own
question in a curiously musing, detached tone. "I
suppose the only way in which such a situation is ever
terminated is by death."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said slowly, "but it's not a usual termination.
Still, I have known it happen." More lightly
she went on: "If Laura died, Godfrey wouldn't escape
Katty a second time. And one must admit that
she would make him an almost perfect wife."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>And if Godfrey died, mother?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell felt a little tremor of fear shoot
through her burdened heart. This secret, intimate
conversation held in the starry night was drifting into
strange, sinister, uncharted channels. But her son
was waiting for an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know how far Laura's life would alter for
the better if Godfrey died. I suppose she would go on
much as she does now. And, Oliver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should pity and&mdash;rather despise the man who
would waste his life in an unrequited devotion."</p>

<p class="indent">He made an impatient movement. "Then do you
regard response as essential in every relationship between
a man and a woman?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
"I have never yet known a man who did not regard
it as essential," she said quietly, "and that, however
he might consciously or unconsciously pretend to be
satisfied with&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">"I once knew a man," he said, in a low, tense voice,
"who for years loved a woman who seemed unresponsive,
who forced him to be content with the merest
crumbs of&mdash;well, <i>she</i> called it friendship. And
yet, mother, that man was happy in his love. And
towards the end of her life the woman gave all that he
had longed for, all he had schooled himself to believe
it was not in her to give&mdash;but it had been there all the
time! She had suffered, poor angel, more than he&mdash;"
his voice broke, and his mother, turning towards him,
laid for a moment her hand on his, as she whispered,
"Was that woman at all like Laura, my darling?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;as far as a Spaniard, and a Roman Catholic,
can be like Laura, she was like Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">Even as he spoke he had risen to his feet, and
during their short walk, from the bench where they
had been sitting through the trees and across the lawn,
neither spoke to the other. But, as he opened the
house door, he said, "Good-night. I'm not coming in
now; I'm going for a walk. I haven't walked all day."
He hesitated a moment: "Don't be worried&mdash;I won't
say don't be frightened, for I don't believe, mother,
that anything could ever frighten you&mdash;if you hear me
coming in rather late. I've got to think out a rather
difficult problem&mdash;something connected with my business."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope Gillie hasn't been getting into any scrape
since you've come home?"</p>

<p class="indent">But she only spoke by way of falling in with his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
humour. Nothing mattered to her, or to him, just
now, except&mdash;Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">He said hastily, "Oh no, things have been going
very well out there. You must remember, mother,
that Baynton's scrapes never affect his work."</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke absently, and she realised that he wanted
to be away, by himself, to think over some of the
things she had said to him, and so she turned and
went slowly up the staircase, and passed through into
her own bedroom without turning up the light.</p>

<p class="indent">Walking over to her window, she gazed down into
the moonlit space beneath. But she could see no
moving shadow, hear no sound. Oliver had padded
away across the grass, making for the lonely downs
which encircled, on three sides, the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Before turning away from her window, Mrs. Tropenell
covered her face with her hands; she was fearfully
moved, shaken to the depths of her heart. For
the first time Oliver had bared his soul before her.
She thrilled with pride in the passionate, wayward,
in a measure nobly selfless and generous human being
whom she had created.</p>

<p class="indent">How strange, how amazing that Laura made no
response to that ardent, exalted passion! But if amazing,
then also, from what ought to be every point
of view, how fortunate! And yet, unreasonable though
it was, Mrs. Tropenell felt sharply angered with Laura,
irritated by that enigmatic, self-absorbed, coldness of
hers. What a poor maimed creature, to be so blind, so
imperceptive, to the greatest thing in the world! Dislike,
a physical distaste for the unlucky Godfrey which
seemed sometimes to amount to horror, were this
beautiful woman's nearest approach to passion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="cap">AT Rosedean, the small, mid-Victorian house which
every one going to and fro between Freshley
Manor and Lawford Chase was bound to pass by,
Mrs. Winslow sat in her drawing-room waiting for
Godfrey Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">He was coming in to see her on his way home from
Pewsbury, where, at the Bank, he spent each day at
least six of his waking hours.</p>

<p class="indent">All the summer, up to to-day, Mrs. Winslow had
always had tea in the garden, but there was now a
freshness in the air, and she thought they would find
it more comfortable indoors than out. Still, she had
opened wide the long French window, and the wind
blew in, laden with pungent autumnal scents.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty&mdash;the old childish name still clung to her&mdash;was
a very clever woman. She possessed the power of
getting the utmost out of the people round her,
whether they were friends, acquaintances, or servants.
Her little garden was exquisitely kept, and there was
no month of the year when it did not look charming.
Her little house, so far as was possible on very limited
means, was perfectly ordered.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps one secret of her success lay in the fact
that she was able to do everything herself that she
asked others to do for her. Katty was a good gardener,
an excellent cook, and an exceptionally clever
dressmaker. Yet she was the last woman to make the
mistake so many clever people make&mdash;of keeping a dog
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
and doing the barking oneself. Katty was willing to
show those she employed exactly how she wanted a
thing done, but she expected them to learn how to do
it quickly and intelligently. She had no use for the
idle or the stupid.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty Winslow was thirty-one, but she looked much
younger. She was an exceedingly pretty woman, with
brown eyes, a delicately clear, white and pink complexion,
and curling chestnut hair. She took great pains
with her appearance, and with her health. Thus she
ate and drank to rule, and almost walked to rule.</p>

<p class="indent">Early this last summer a bit of cruel bad luck had
befallen Mrs. Winslow. She had caught scarlet fever
while on a visit, and for some days had been very ill.
But, perhaps as a result of the long, dull convalescence,
she now looked even prettier, and yes, younger, than
she had done before.</p>

<p class="indent">The only daughter of a well-connected but exceedingly
poor half-pay officer, Katherine Fenton, during
a girlhood which lasted till she was four-and-twenty,
had been undisputed belle of Pewsbury, and of a country-side
stretching far beyond the confines of that fine
old county town. Like all beauties, she had had her
triumphs and her disappointments; and then, rather
suddenly, she had made what had seemed the irretrievable
mistake of an unhappy marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Winslow had been weak, vain, ill-tempered,
and, to a certain extent, vicious. Thus his relations
had welcomed his marriage to a clever, capable young
woman, who it was supposed would make, and keep,
him straight. The fact that she had no fortune had
been regarded as unimportant&mdash;indeed, Bob Winslow
had made on his bride what was regarded in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
Pewsbury world as the splendid marriage settlement of
twelve thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Four and a half per cent, on that sum was now
Mrs. Winslow's only income, and out of that income
there were still being paid off heavy divorce costs, for
Bob Winslow, when it had come to the point, had
put up a great fight for his Katty. Not only had he
defended the case, but he had brought on his side
vague counter-charges. The Judge, rather unkindly,
had observed that the petitioner had been "somewhat
imprudent," but even so Katty had come out of the
painful ordeal very well&mdash;so much was universally
allowed, even by the few people in Pewsbury who had
always disliked her, and who did not think she had
treated her husband well.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey and Laura Pavely had both been very
kind to Katty over the matter of the divorce&mdash;indeed,
Mrs. Winslow had actually stayed at Lawford Chase
for many weeks during that troubled time, and Laura's
countenance had been of great value to her. This was
now three years ago, and, though they had nothing
in common, the two women remained good friends,
as well as what is sometimes less usual, good neighbours.</p>

<p class="indent">In nothing had Katty shown herself cleverer than in
her management of Laura. In Laura Pavely's imagination
Katty Winslow had her fixed place as a
friend of Godfrey's childhood, and that though he
was nine years older. Mrs. Pavely regarded Mrs.
Winslow much as she would have done a pleasant-natured
sister-in-law, and she had been glad to do all
that she could for her. When some one had suggested
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
that Katty should become Godfrey Pavely's tenant
at Rosedean, Laura had thought it an excellent idea.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the fashion to call Rosedean ugly. The
house had been built in the 'sixties, by a retired butcher
and grazier, and was of red brick with white facings.
But it was well built, and had far more real distinction
of appearance than the Queen Anne villas which
now surrounded Pewsbury. Also, Rosedean had been
built on the site of an old farmhouse, and Katty's
lawn was fringed with some fine old trees, while a
grand old holly hedge concealed a well-stocked kitchen
garden. On the other side of the house were stabling
for two horses, a coach-house, and a paddock.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty had devoted a great deal of successful thought
to the arrangement of her dwelling. She knew she
could neither compete with the stately beauty of
Laura's Tudor mansion, nor with the old-fashioned
eighteenth-century charm of Mrs. Tropenell's house,
so she wisely made up her mind that her surroundings
should be simply bright, pretty and cosy. Her drawing-room
was in its way a delightful room, and those
walking through into it, from the rather dark, early
Victorian hall, gained an instant impression of coolness
in summer, of warmth in winter, of cheerfulness
and comfort at all times.</p>

<p class="indent">No one but Katty herself knew the trouble to which
she had been to get the exact pattern of calendered
chintz which she had made up her mind to obtain.
Katty also kept to herself the amount which she had
spent, out of her small reserve, on the thoroughly good,
comfortable easy-chairs, of varying shape, height, and
depth, which played such an important, if unobtrusive,
part in the comfort of her visitors.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
Every chair in Katty's sitting-room was an easy
chair, with the exception of two gilt ones which were
of their kind good, and which she had bought at a
sale. They, however, were never moved away from
the places where they stood, flanking a quaint, old-fashioned
cabinet now filled with some beautiful old
china which had come to Katty from a grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another peculiarity of Katty's sitting-room was
the absence of pictures. Their place was taken by
mirrors. Above the mantelpiece on which stood six
delicately charming Dresden china figures was a looking-glass
of curious octagonal shape, framed in rosewood.
Opposite the French window which opened
into the garden was fixed a long, narrow mirror with
a finely carved gilt wood frame. This mirror gave
an air of distinction to the room which would otherwise
have been lacking, and it also enabled Katty
to see at any moment how she was looking, whether
her burnished chestnut-brown hair was quite tidy, and
her gown fresh-looking and neat.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been a time in her life when Katty
Winslow had been passionately fond of beautiful
clothes, and able to indulge her taste. Now, all she
could hope to attain was freshness and neatness. That
she achieved these was to her credit, for they too cost,
if not money, then a good deal of thought and time,
on the part of their possessor.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely had walked out from Pewsbury.
From the Bank in the High Street to Rosedean was
rather over two miles, and he had gone along at a
steady, jog-trot pace till he had come in sight of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
little house. Then he quickened his footsteps, and a
feeling of pleasurable anticipation came over him.</p>

<p class="indent">The banker was very, very fond of his old friend
and sometime sweetheart. He believed it to be a
straightforward, honest affection, though he could not
but be aware, deep in his heart, that "to it" was just
that little touch of sentiment which adds salt and
savour to most of the close friendships formed between
a man and a woman.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, Godfrey Pavely was now happier
in Katty Winslow's company than he was in that
of any one else. Not only did she ply him with a
good deal of delicate flattery, which caused him always
to feel better pleased with himself when at Rosedean
than when he was at The Chase, but a great and
real bond between them was their mutual interest in
all the local happenings and local gossip of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was frankly indifferent to all that concerned
the town of Pewsbury and the affairs of those whom
Mrs. Tropenell called the Pewsburyites. She was
not disagreeable about it; she simply didn't care.
Katty, in spite of her frequent absences, for she was
a popular visitor with a large circle of acquaintances,
always came home full of an eager wish to learn all
that had happened while she had been away.</p>

<p class="indent">Little by little, imperceptibly as regarded himself,
the banker had fallen into the way of telling this
woman, who had so oddly slipped back into his life,
everything which concerned and interested himself,
every detail of his business, and even, which he had
no right to do, the secrets of his clients.</p>

<p class="indent">But to this entire confidence there was one outstanding
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
exception. Godfrey Pavely never discussed with
Katty Winslow his relations with his wife. Laura's
attitude to himself caused him, even now, sharp, almost
intolerable, humiliation. Only to Mrs. Tropenell
did he ever say a word of his resentment and soreness&mdash;and
that only because she had been the unwilling
confidant of both husband and wife during that early
time in their married life when the struggle between
Godfrey and Laura had been, if almost wordless, at
its sharpest and bitterest.</p>

<p class="indent">On one occasion, and on one only, when with Katty
Winslow, had Pavely broken his guarded silence. He
had been talking, in a way which at once fascinated
and tantalised Katty, of his growing wealth,
and suddenly he had said something as to his having
no son to inherit his fortune. "It's odd to think that
some day there will come along a man, a stranger to
me, who will benefit by everything I now do&mdash;&mdash;" and
as she had looked up at him, at a loss for his meaning,
he had gone on, slowly, "I mean the man whom
Mrs. Tropenell and Laura between them will select for
my girl's husband."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty, looking at him very straight out of her
bright brown eyes, had exclaimed, "You may have a
son yet, Godfrey!"</p>

<p class="indent">She had been startled by the look of pain, of rage,
and of humiliation that had come into his sulky, obstinate-looking
face, as he answered shortly, "I think
that's very unlikely."</p>

<p class="indent">Had Godfrey Pavely been a more imaginative man,
he would probably by now have come to regret, with
a deep, voiceless regret, that he had not married Katty
instead of Laura&mdash;but being the manner of man he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
was, he had, so far, done nothing of the sort. And
yet? And yet, at one time, say fifteen years ago,
he had very nearly married Katty. It was a fact
which even now he would have denied, but which she
never forgot.</p>

<p class="indent">In those days Godfrey Pavely had been a priggish,
self-important young man of twenty-six, with perhaps
not so good an opinion of women as he had now,
for a man's opinion of women always alters, one way
or another, as he grows older.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty, at eighteen, had enjoyed playing on the cautious,
judgematical Godfrey's emotions. So well had
she succeeded that at one time he could hardly let a
day go by without trying to see and to be with her
alone. But, though strongly attracted by her instinctive,
girlish wiles, he was also, quite unknowingly to
her, repelled by those same wiles.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Katty had made herself, in those days that
now seemed to both of them so very, very long ago,
a little too cheap. Her admirer, to use a good old
word, knew that her appeal was to a side of his nature
which it behooved him to keep in check, if he
was not "to make a fool of himself." And so, just
when their little world&mdash;kindly, malicious, censorious,
as the case might be&mdash;was expecting to hear of their
engagement, Godfrey Pavely suddenly left Pewsbury
to spend a year in a great Paris discount house.</p>

<p class="indent">The now staid country banker did not look back
with any pride or pleasure to that year in France; he
had worked, but he had also ignobly played, spending,
rather joylessly, a great deal of money in the process.
Then, having secretly sown his wild oats, he had come
home and settled down to a further time of banking
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
apprenticeship in London, before taking over the
sound family business.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost at once, on his return to England, he had
made up his mind to marry the beautiful, reserved, the
then pathetically young Laura Baynton, who was so
constantly with Mrs. Tropenell at Freshley Manor.</p>

<p class="indent">Time went on, and Laura held out; but little by little,
perhaps because he saw her so seldom, he broke
down her resistance. His father had bought the Lawford
Chase estate as a great bargain, many years
before, and had been content to let it on a long lease.
Godfrey, on becoming his own master at thirty, determined
to live there, and his marriage to Laura followed
a year later.</p>

<p class="indent">During their honeymoon in Paris&mdash;a honeymoon
which was curiously and painfully unlike what Godfrey
had supposed his honeymoon would and must
be&mdash;he saw in a paper a notice of Katty Fenton's engagement.
Though not given to impulsively generous
actions, he went out and bought for Katty, in the
Rue de la Paix, a jewelled pendant Laura had just
refused to allow him to buy for her. In return he had
received what had seemed at the time a delightful letter
of thanks, to which was the following postscript,
"There's no harm in my saying <i>now</i>, that you, dear
Godfrey, were my first love! I've always wanted you
to know that. I've always been afraid that you only
thought me a sad little flirt."</p>

<p class="indent">The confession, and the shrewd thrust, which was
so much truer than he thought Katty knew, moved
him, and he had told himself sorely that Katty's husband
at any rate would be a very lucky fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">Then once more he had forgotten Katty till one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
day, years later, "Mrs. Winslow" had suddenly been
shown into his private room at the Bank.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking, as he had at once become aware, even
prettier and more attractive than when he had last
seen her, she had said quietly, "I'm in great trouble,
Godfrey, and I've come down from London to consult
you about it. Your father and mine were friends" (a
rather exaggerated statement that&mdash;but Pavely was
in no mood to cavil), "and I don't know who else to
go to."</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly and simply she had described the dreadful
existence she had led since her marriage&mdash;then, suddenly,
she had rolled up her right sleeve and shown
the livid bruises made by Bob Winslow the night before,
in a fit of drunken anger, on the slender, soft,
white arm.</p>

<p class="indent">Unwontedly moved, the more so that this now unfamiliar
Katty seemed to make no excessive demand
either on his pity or on his emotions, Godfrey Pavely
had thrown himself into the complicated, unsavoury
business, and very soon his old-new friend had brought
him to advise her in the sense she wished. But it was
Laura who had suggested that poor Mrs. Winslow
should come and stay with them during the divorce
proceedings, and while she had been at Lawford
Chase, Katty had avoided, rather than sought out, the
master of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">In the matter of Rosedean the banker had behaved
in what he himself considered a very handsome manner.
Not only had he let the house to Katty for about
a third of what he could have got for it in the open
market, but he had allowed her a hundred pounds for
"doing it up." He believed himself to have also suggested
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
the arrangement by which she obtained the free
services, for a certain number of half-days each week,
of a very intelligent Scotch under-gardener who was
in his employ.</p>

<p class="indent">He had never had reason to regret his kindness.
On the contrary, he and Katty had become, as time
went on, closer and closer friends, and more and more
had he come to miss her during her frequent absences
from home.</p>

<p class="indent">Some months ago he had even ventured to tell her
that he thought she gadded about a bit too much!
Why couldn't she be content to stay quietly at Rosedean?
"Look at me and Laura," he had exclaimed.
"We hardly ever go away for a holiday, and we very
seldom pay a visit!" Katty had shaken her pretty
head playfully: "Ah, but you don't know how lonely
I am sometimes! Laura is most dear and kind to me,
but you know, Godfrey, I don't see her often&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He had not liked to remind her that he very often
did.</p>

<p class="indent">Then something happened which quite curiously
quickened Godfrey Pavely's unavowed feeling for
Katty. Oliver Tropenell, a virtual stranger to them
all, came home from Mexico to spend the summer in
England with his mother. And three times, during
Oliver's first fortnight in England, Godfrey arrived
at Rosedean to find the then stranger there. On these
three occasions each man had tried to sit the other
out, and finally they had left the house together. As
a result of these meetings Godfrey soon caught himself
wondering with a mixture of feelings he did
not care to analyse, whether Tropenell could possibly
be thinking of marrying Katty?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
He found the notion intolerable.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came a strange turn to the situation. Katty
had gone away, on one of those tiresome little visits
she was so fond of paying, and Providence, which
means women, especially any woman placed in an ambiguous
position, to stay quietly at home, had caught
her out! She had fallen ill, when on a visit, of scarlet
fever, and she had been compelled to stay away six
weeks. During those weeks he, Godfrey Pavely, and
Oliver Tropenell had become friends&mdash;on more intimate
terms of friendship than Pavely had ever expected
to find himself with any man. This was, of
course, partly owing to the fortunate fact that Laura
liked Oliver too, and didn't seem to mind how often
he came and went to The Chase.</p>

<p class="indent">But Godfrey Pavely had a tenacious memory. He
did not forget that for a little while, at any rate, Oliver
had seemed to enjoy being in Katty's company. And
when Laura, more than once since Mrs. Winslow's return
to Rosedean, had suggested asking Katty in to
dinner to meet Oliver, her husband coldly vetoed the
proposal.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="cap">ONLY Harber, the woman who, after having been
maid to Katty during her troubled married life,
had stayed on with her as house-parlourmaid and
general factotum, was aware of how very often Mr.
Pavely called at Rosedean on his daily walk home from
Pewsbury. To-day he had hardly pressed the bell-knob
before the front door opened. It was almost as
if Harber had been waiting for him in the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">As he put down his hat and stick he was conscious
of feeling very glad that he was going to see Katty.
Mrs. Winslow had again been away, was it for four
days, or five? It's true that for part of that time he
himself had been to London, and very busy, but even
so the time had seemed long. He told himself that
he had a hundred things to say to her, and he even
felt a little thrill of excitement as he followed the
servant through the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">And Katty? Katty, who the moment she had heard
the front-door bell had quietly begun making the tea&mdash;she
always made tea herself, with the help of a
pretty spirit lamp&mdash;Katty also felt a queer little thrill,
but for a very different reason. Since they had last
met she had come to a certain resolution with regard
to Godfrey Pavely, and though she did not mean to
say anything to-day even remotely bearing on it, still
it affected her, made her regard him with rather different
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a great mistake to think that coldness and calculation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
always go together. Katty Winslow was calculating,
but she was not cold. For once she had been
quite honest when writing that odd little postscript to
her letter of thanks for Godfrey Pavely's wedding
present. Godfrey had, in very truth, been her first
love, and she had suffered acutely in her heart, as well
as in her pride, when he had run away. Even now,
she felt as if there were a strong, secret, passionate
link between them, and there was no day when she
did not tell herself that she would have made the
banker a perfect, and yes&mdash;a very happy wife.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Godfrey came into the drawing-room with a pleased,
eager look on his face. He took his hostess's hand in
his, and held it for perhaps a thought longer than
he would have held, say, Mrs. Tropenell's hand. But
the hand he now held was a soft, malleable little hand,
not thin and firm, like that of Oliver's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was smiling at him, such a bright, friendly,
pretty smile. "Sit down," she said softly. "And before
we begin talking, take a cup of tea. You look
very tired&mdash;and you're late, too, Godfrey. I was beginning
to think that you weren't coming at all!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then he said something which surprised her, but
which somehow chimed in quite surprisingly with
what had been filling her busy, active brain of late.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jim Beath has been with me most of the afternoon,"
he spoke wearily, complainingly. "I had to
ask him to lunch at the Club, and he stayed on and
on."</p>

<p class="indent">Now the Beaths were by way of being intimate
friends of Katty Winslow, and Jim Beath was a
client of Godfrey Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
"Oh, but that's very interesting!" she cried. "I've
been wondering so much how that affair is going on&mdash;I
do so hope it will be all right!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then, as she saw a shocked look come over
her visitor's narrow, rather fleshy face, she said in
a low voice, "You know how I feel about the divorce
laws, Godfrey. I can't help it. They're horribly unfair&mdash;so&mdash;so
ridiculous, in fact!"</p>

<p class="indent">As he remained silent, she went on, insisting on her
own point of view far more than was her usual way
when talking to her self-opinionated friend: "Don't
you realise how hard it is that two people utterly unsuited
to one another should have to go through that
sort of horrid farce just in order to get free?"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her uncomfortably. Sometimes, even
now, Katty startled him by the things she said. But
how pretty she looked to-day, bending over the tea-things!
Her burnished hair was dressed in thick soft
coils, her white, well-manicured hand busily engaged
in pouring him out just the cup of tea he liked, with
the exact proportions of milk, cream, and sugar that
were right&mdash;and which Laura never remembered.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was mildly that he answered: "I don't think
the Beaths ought to want to get what you call 'free.'
Divorce was not instituted to meet a case like
theirs&mdash;" he hesitated, and then with a certain effort
he went on: "Divorce was instituted to meet a case
like yours, Katty."</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely was weary of the Beaths and of
their divorce plot&mdash;for so he called it to himself.
There were other things he wanted to talk to Katty
about. Besides, he did not think that that sort of
affair was a nice subject of discussion between a man
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
and a woman, however intimate. In some ways Godfrey
Pavely was very old-fashioned.</p>

<p class="indent">But she wouldn't let it alone. "Divorce <i>ought</i> to
meet a case like theirs," she went on obstinately.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Katty! What would happen to the
country if all the married people who didn't get on
with one another were to separate?"</p>

<p class="indent">And then, looking at her defiant face, a most extraordinary
and disagreeable suspicion darted into Godfrey
Pavely's mind. Was it possible, conceivable, that
Katty was thinking of Jim Beath as a second husband
for herself? The thought shook him with anger and
with repugnance. He felt he must have that out&mdash;here
and now.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you like Jim Beath?" he asked slowly; "I
know you've been seeing a great deal of them this
last year. In fact, he mentioned you to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">She could read him like a book, and she remained
silent long enough to make him feel increasingly suspicious
and uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="indent">But to-day Katty was not in the mood for a cat-and-mouse
game, so she answered deliberately: "No, Godfrey,
I can't say that I do like Jim Beath! I've tried
to like him. But&mdash;well, I do thoroughly understand
Nita's feeling towards him. He's so sarcastic&mdash;so
hard and unsympathetic!" She waited a moment, then
added significantly: "Still, I think he's behaving awfully
well now. He'd have been quite willing to go
on&mdash;he told me that himself. But when he saw that
Nita was <i>really</i> unhappy, and that she was getting
fond of another man, he made up his mind that he
would do all he could to make her free."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was playing rather nervously with the edge
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
of the pretty tea-cloth, and Pavely wondered whether
she was telling him the whole truth. She was flushed,
and she looked unwontedly moved.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a very odd thing for a man to do," he said
coldly. "I mean a man being willing to give up his
wife to another man."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why shouldn't he? When he doesn't love her,
and when she positively dislikes him! Nita never
understood Jim Beath&mdash;she was always afraid of him,
and of his sharp, clever tongue. Of course it's sad
about their little boy. But they've made a very good
arrangement&mdash;they're going to share him. Jim will
have the child half the year, and Nita the other half,
till he goes to school&mdash;when they will have him for
alternate holidays."</p>

<p class="indent">"You talk as if it was all settled!" Katty's visitor
exclaimed crossly. "If they say as much to other
people as they seem to do to you, they will never
get their divorce&mdash;the King's Proctor is sure to intervene!"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty gave a quick, curious look at her visitor. Godfrey
went too far&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p class="indent">The thought flashed through her mind that she was
wasting her life, her few remaining years of youth,
on a man who would never be more to her than he
was now, unless&mdash;unless, that is, she could bring him
to the point of putting himself imaginatively, emotionally
into Jim Beath's shoes. <i>Then</i> everything
might be changed. But was there any hope of such a
thing coming to pass?</p>

<p class="indent">But all she said, in a constrained tone, was, "Of
course I ought not to have said anything of the matter
to you at all. But I'm afraid, Godfrey, that I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
often do tell you things I ought to keep to myself. You
must try and forget what I said."</p>

<p class="indent">He was surprised, bewildered, by the sudden steely
coldness of her tone. "Of course you can say anything
you like to say to me. Why, Katty, I tell you
all my secrets!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you?" She glanced over at him rather sharply.
"I don't think you tell me <i>all</i> your secrets, Godfrey."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her puzzled. "You <i>know</i> that I do,"
he said in a low voice. "Come, Katty, you're not being
fair! It's because I have such a high regard for
you, that I feel sorry when you talk as you've been
talking just now&mdash;as if, after all, the marriage bond
didn't matter."</p>

<p class="indent">But even as he said these words, Godfrey Pavely
felt a wild impulse to throw over the pretty little gimcrack
tea-table, take Katty in his arms, and kiss her,
kiss her, kiss her! He came back, with an inward
start, to hear her exclaim,</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't consider the peculiar relations which exist
between Nita and Jim Beath a marriage at all! They
have nothing in common the one with the other.
What interests him doesn't interest her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She waited a moment, saw that he was reddening
uncomfortably, and then hurried on, driven by some
sudden instinct that she was at last playing on the
hidden chord she had so often longed to find and
strike in Godfrey Pavely's sore heart: "Nita can't bear
Jim to touch her&mdash;she will hardly shake hands with
him! Do you call <i>that</i> a marriage?"</p>

<p class="indent">As he remained silent, she suddenly said in a voice
so low as to be almost a whisper, "Forgive me, Godfrey.
I&mdash;I ought not have said that to you."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
He answered loudly, discordantly, "I don't know
what you mean, Katty! Why shouldn't you say anything
you like about these people? They are nothing,
and less than nothing to me, and I don't suppose
they're very much to you."</p>

<p class="indent">Even as he spoke he had got up out of the easy
chair into which he had sunk with such happy content
a few minutes before. "I must be going now," he
said heavily, "Oliver Tropenell's coming in for a
game of tennis at six."</p>

<p class="indent">She made no effort to keep him, though she longed
to say to him: "Oliver Tropenell's been in your house,
and in your garden, all afternoon. Both he and Laura
would be only too pleased if you stayed on here till
dinner-time."</p>

<p class="indent">But instead of saying that, she got up, and silently
accompanied him to the front door.</p>

<p class="indent">There poor Godfrey did linger regretfully. He felt
like a child who has been baulked of some promised
treat&mdash;not by his own fault, but by the fault of those
about him. "Will you be in to-morrow?" he asked
abruptly. "I think I might come in a little earlier
to-morrow, Katty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, do come to-morrow! I seem to have a hundred
things to say to you. I'm sorry we wasted the
little time we had to-day in talking over those tiresome
people and their matrimonial affairs."</p>

<p class="indent">There was also a look of regret in her face, and
suddenly he told himself that he might have been mistaken
just now, and that she had meant nothing&mdash;nothing
in the least personal or&mdash;or probing, in what she
had said. "Look here!" he said awkwardly. "If
there's anything you really want to say&mdash;you said you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
had a hundred things to tell me&mdash;would you like me to
come back for a few minutes? There's no great hurry,
you know&mdash;I mean about Tropenell and his game."</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, and to his moved surprise, the
tears came into her pretty brown eyes. "No, not now.
I'm tired, Godfrey. It's rather absurd, but I haven't
really got over my journey yet; I think I shall have
to take your advice, and stay at home rather more."</p>

<p class="indent">For a long moment they advanced towards one another
as if something outside themselves was drawing
them together. Then Godfrey Pavely put out his
hand, and grasped hers firmly. It was almost as if he
was holding her back&mdash;at arm's length.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty laughed nervously. She shook her hand free
of his, opened the door wide, and exclaimed: "Well!
Good-bye till to-morrow then. My love to Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">She shut the door behind him, and, turning, went
slowly upstairs. She felt tired, weak, upset&mdash;and,
what she did not often feel, restless and unhappy as
well. It irritated her&mdash;nay, it did more than irritate,
it hurt her shrewdly&mdash;to think of those three people
who were about to spend a pleasant couple of hours
together. She could so easily, so safely, have made a
fourth at their constant meetings.</p>

<p class="indent">If only Laura Pavely were a little less absorbed in
herself, a little more what ordinary people called good-natured!
It would have been so natural for Laura,
when she knew that Oliver Tropenell was coming to
dinner, to send across to Rosedean, and ask her, Katty,
to make a fourth. It was not as if Laura was at all
jealous. She was as little jealous of Godfrey and of
Katty&mdash;and at that thought Katty gave a queer, bitter
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
little laugh which startled her, for she had laughed
aloud&mdash;as was Godfrey of Laura and Oliver! With
as little or as much reason? Katty would have given
a great deal to be able to answer her own question.
She thought she knew half the answer&mdash;but it was,
alas! by far the less important half.</p>

<p class="indent">She opened the door of her bedroom, went through
into it, and without troubling to take off her pretty
blouse and freshly ironed linen skirt, walked deliberately
to her bed, lay down, and shut her eyes&mdash;not to
sleep but to think.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">What had been forced upon Katty Winslow's notice
during the last few weeks had created a revolution
in her mind and in her plans.</p>

<p class="indent">For a while, after her return from that dreary period
of convalescence in a seaside home, she, who was
generally so positive, had doubted the evidence of her
own eyes and senses. But gradually that which she
would have deemed the last thing likely to happen had
emerged, startlingly clear. Oliver Tropenell, to use
Katty's own expression, had fallen madly in love with
Laura Pavely. No woman could doubt that who saw
them together. When Katty had left Rosedean, there
had been the beginnings of&mdash;well, not exactly a flirtation,
but a very pleasant friendship between Tropenell
and herself. Now he hardly seemed to know that she
existed.</p>

<p class="indent">But if it was only too plain to see how matters stood
with Oliver, this was far from being the case as regarded
Laura. Katty owned herself quite ignorant
of Laura's real nature, and, as is so often the case
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
with those who know nothing, she was inclined to
believe that there was nothing to know.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps, after all, it was only because this man was
the son of her friend that Laura allowed him to be
always with her. They were always together&mdash;not always
alone, for Oliver seemed to be at The Chase
quite as much when Godfrey was at home, as at other
times. But with Katty, she being the manner of
woman she was, it was the other times which impressed
her imagination. In the six short weeks she, Katty,
had been away, Oliver Tropenell had evidently become
a component part of Laura Pavely's life.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew, vaguely, how the two spent their time,
and the knowledge irked her&mdash;the more that it suggested
nothing of their real relations. Thus gardening
was one of Laura's favourite occupations and
few pleasures; and Oliver, who could never have gardened
before&mdash;what gardening could there be to do
in Mexico?&mdash;now spent hours out of doors with
Laura, carrying out her behests, behaving just as an
under-gardener would behave, when working under his
mistress's directions.</p>

<p class="indent">And Godfrey, instead of objecting to this extraordinary
state of things, seemed quite pleased. Oliver,
so much was clear, had become Godfrey Pavely's
friend almost as much as he was Laura's.</p>

<p class="indent">As she lay there, straight out on her bed, Katty
told herself with terrible bitterness that it was indeed
an amazing state of things to which she had come back&mdash;one
which altered her own life in a strange degree.
She had not realised, till these last few weeks, how
much Godfrey Pavely was to her, and how jealous she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
could become even of such an affection as his cordial
liking of Oliver Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet when Godfrey was actually with her, she retained
all her old ascendency over him; in certain
ways it had perhaps even increased. It was as if his
unsuspecting proximity to another man's strong, secret
passion warmed his sluggish, cautious nature.</p>

<p class="indent">But that curious fact had not made his friend
Katty's part any the more easy of late. Far from it!
There was no pleasing Godfrey in these days. He was
hurt if she was cold; shocked, made uneasy in his
conscience, if she responded in ever so slight a way to
the little excursions in sentiment he sometimes half-ashamedly
permitted himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Tears came into her eyes, and rolled slowly down
her cheeks, as she recalled what had happened a few
moments ago in the hall. He had been aching to
take her in his arms and kiss her&mdash;kiss her as he had
been wont to do, in the old days, in the shabby little
lodging where she lived with her father. Poor little
motherless girl, who had thought herself so clever.
At that time she had believed herself to be as good as
engaged to "young Mr. Pavely," as the Pewsbury
folk called him. Even now she could remember, as
if it had happened yesterday, the bitter humiliation, as
well as the pain which had shaken her, when she had
learnt, casually, of his sudden disappearance from
Pewsbury.</p>

<p class="indent">What hypocrites men were! The fact that often
they were unconscious hypocrites afforded Katty little
consolation.</p>

<p class="indent">It was plain that Godfrey was quite unaware of
Oliver's growing absorption in Laura, but that surely
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
was not to his credit. A man of his age, and with his
experience of life, ought to have known, ought to have
guessed, ought to have seen&mdash;by now! Instead, he
remained absorbed in himself, in the tiresome little
business interests of his prosperous life, in his new
friendship for Oliver Tropenell, and&mdash;in that ambiguous,
tantalising friendship with herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Again she told herself that she was wasting what
remained to her of youth and of vitality over a thoroughly
unsatisfactory state of things, and painfully
she determined that, if what she had gradually come
to plan since her return home did not come to pass,
she would leave Rosedean, and make another life for
herself elsewhere.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The things Katty toiled and schemed for had a way
of coming to pass. She had planned her divorce long
before it had actually taken place, at a time indeed
when it seemed impossible to believe that it ever could
take place. Bob Winslow had been adoringly, slavishly
devoted to her for more than two-thirds of their
married life, and it had taken her trouble and time to
drive him into the courses it was necessary he should
pursue to procure her freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">She had no doubt&mdash;there could be no doubt&mdash;that
were Godfrey free he would turn to her instinctively at
once. She was well aware of her power over him, and
till lately she had been virtuously proud of what she
imagined to be her loyalty to Laura. Also she had
had no wish to make her own position at Rosedean untenable.</p>

<p class="indent">Even as it was, Godfrey came far too often to see
her. Had she lived nearer to Pewsbury, even a mile
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
nearer, his frequent calls on her would have meant a
flood of ill-natured gossip in the little town.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, the situation, from Katty's point of view, was
thoroughly unsatisfactory, and, as far as she was
concerned, it was time it was ended or mended. And
then, once more, for the hundredth time, her restless,
excited mind swung back to what was to her just
now the real mystery, the all-important problem&mdash;the
relations between Oliver Tropenell and Laura Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course it was possible&mdash;though Katty thought
not likely&mdash;that Tropenell was still unaware of his
passion for Laura. Perhaps he still disguised it under
the name of "friendship." But even if that were so,
such a state of things could not endure for very long.
Any day some trifling happening might open his eyes,
and, yes&mdash;why not?&mdash;Godfrey's.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="cap">GODFREY PAVELY was standing in his private
room at Pavely's Bank. It was only a little after
ten, and he had not been in the room many minutes,
yet already he had got up from his writing-table and
moved over to the middle one of the three windows
overlooking the prim, exquisitely kept walled garden,
which even nowadays reminded him of his early childhood.
He had gazed out of the window for a few
moments, but now he stood with his back to the window,
staring unseeingly before him, a piece of note
paper crushed up in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">For close on a hundred years his well-to-do careful-living
forbears had passed their pleasant, uneventful
lives in this spacious Georgian house, set in the
centre of the wide High Street of the prosperous
market town of Pewsbury.</p>

<p class="indent">What was now known as "Mr. Pavely's own room"
had been the dining-room of his grandparents. He
himself had always known it as part of the Bank, but
it still had some of the characteristics of a private living-room.
Thus, on the dark green walls hung a number
of quaint family portraits, his great-grandfather,
his grandfather and grandmother, two uncles who
had died in youth, and a presentation portrait of his
own father. These were arranged about and above
the mantelpiece, opposite the place where stood his
wide, leather-topped writing-table.</p>

<p class="indent">Taking up most of the wall opposite the windows
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
was a bookcase of really distinguished beauty. Godfrey
Pavely had been gratified to learn, some five or
six years ago, that this piece of furniture was of very
considerable value, owing to the fact that it was supposed
to have been, in a special sense, the work and
design of Chippendale himself. But just now, at this
moment, he felt as if he hated the substantial old
house and everything in it.</p>

<p class="indent">He had come into this room, twenty minutes ago,
to find the usual pile of open letters on the table. On
the top of the pile was an unopened envelope marked
<i>Private</i>, and it was the contents of that envelope that
he now held crushed up&mdash;not torn up&mdash;in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">And as he stood there, staring before him unseeingly
at the bookcase, there suddenly flashed into his
mind a vision of the first time he had brought Laura
here, to his own room at the Bank. They had only
just became engaged, and he was still feeling an almost
oppressive joy of having compassed that which
he had so steadfastly desired.</p>

<p class="indent">He could see her graceful figure walking through
the mahogany door, he could almost hear her exclaim,
"What a charming room, Godfrey! I can't
help wishing that we were going to live here, in Pewsbury!"</p>

<p class="indent">She had gone over and stood exactly where he was
standing now, and then she had turned and gazed into
the walled garden, at that time brilliant with tulips
and wallflowers. Coming round behind her, he had
put his arm, a little awkwardly, round her shoulders.
At once she had slipped from beneath his grasp, but
not unkindly&mdash;only with a gentle word that at any
moment some one might come in, and he, poor fool
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
that he had been, had admired her maidenly delicacy....</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced down at the piece of notepaper he held
in his hand, and, smoothing it out, he read it through
for the tenth or twelfth time. Then, as there came a
knock at the door, he hastily thrust it into his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come in!" he cried impatiently; and his head clerk
came into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Privet had a delicate, refined, thoughtful face.
He was very much respected in the town, and regarded
as an important, integral part of Pavely's
Bank. He was one of the very few people in the
world who were really attached to Godfrey Pavely,
and he perceived at once that there was something
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">"We promised to send over to Mr. Johnson to say
when you would be ready to see him, sir. Shall I
send over now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;no. Tell him I'll be ready in half an hour.
And, Privet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've a rather important letter to write. Will you
see that I'm not disturbed till I ring?"</p>

<p class="indent">The old man shut the door quietly, and Godfrey
Pavely drew irresolutely towards his writing-table,
the table where he did so much hard, good, and profitable
work each day.</p>

<p class="indent">But he did not sit down at once; instead, he took
the letter he had been so nearly caught reading out
of his pocket, and once more he read it through&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"This is to warn you that there is a great deal of
talk going on in Pewsbury and the surrounding neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
about your wife and a certain gentleman
who is a near neighbour of yours. It is well not to
be jealous, but confidence may be carried too far. Try
going home when you are not expected, and you will
surely find them together.</p>

<p class="margin-left8">"<span class="smcap">A Well-Wisher to the</span></p>

<p class="margin-left16">"<span class="smcap">Pavely Family.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The words had been written, or rather printed, in
ink, on a very common sheet of notepaper&mdash;the kind
of notepaper which is sold in penny packets in every
village and small sweetstuff shop in the kingdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Now in theory there is nothing easier than to
despise and disregard an anonymous letter. But in
practice such a missive as Godfrey Pavely had just
received, however vulgar, and even, as in this case,
obviously written by a malicious person, invariably
produces a horrible sensation of discomfort and acute
uneasiness. For one thing, the fact that some unknown
human being has devoted so much unwonted
thought and spiteful interest to one's private affairs
is in itself an ugly revelation.</p>

<p class="indent">In theory again, most people, if asked what they
would do if they received an anonymous letter, would
reply (1) that they would put it straight in the fire, or
(2) go straight with it to the police. But in practice
an anonymous letter, unless the recipient at once
guesses with certainty the identity of the writer, is
the only clue to what may contain the germ of some
ugly plot, or conspiracy to harm or injure the innocent.
So it is surely foolish to destroy what may become
evidence. As for going to the police, that is,
for obvious reasons, the last thing any man would care
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;101]</span>
to do if the anonymous communication deals with the
character of a woman near and dear to him. Indeed,
the thought of going to the police did not even enter
Godfrey Pavely's mind, though it was probably the
advice he would have given <i>to any one else</i> who had
come to consult him about such a matter.</p>

<p class="indent">As he looked at the letter closely, turning it this way
and that, he suddenly told himself that it did not read
like the work of an illiterate person. Godfrey, and
Laura too, were in their different ways very good employers;
besides, they had not dismissed any one lately.
No, no&mdash;it was far more likely to be some one living in
Pewsbury, probably with whom he was scarcely acquainted.
There were, as the banker could not but
be aware, a good many people in the little town who
had reason to dislike him&mdash;not personally perhaps,
but as the one money-dealer of the place.</p>

<p class="indent">At last he sat down at his writing-table and drew
an envelope towards him. On it he wrote, "To be
destroyed, unopened, in case of my death," and then
he placed the poisonous little sheet of common notepaper
in the envelope, and, fastening it down, put it
in one of his inner pockets.</p>

<p class="indent">He intended to dismiss the whole thing from his
mind, at any rate during this morning, but he found
it very difficult, not to say impossible, to do that.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura and Oliver Tropenell? His thin lips curled
at the thought.</p>

<p class="indent">Why, Oliver liked him, Godfrey, far better than
he did Laura! He regarded that as certain. And
Laura? He could have laughed aloud at the absurd
suggestion. Laura was not only the coldest, she was
also the most upright, of women.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
Early in their married life, when they had gone
about together far more than they had done recently,
he, Godfrey, had never felt even a twinge of jealousy
with regard to her. And yet&mdash;and yet in those days
Laura had certainly excited a good deal of admiration.
There are men who passionately admire that kind of
proud, passionless beauty in a woman. Pavely himself
had once been such a man. So he knew.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up from the letter he was writing, and
all at once, to his own surprise, his thoughts took quite
another turn. He told himself suddenly that Tropenell's
rather exceptional intimacy with them both
might, after all, excite remark, in such a damned
censorious, gossiping place as was Pewsbury. He,
Godfrey Pavely, was well aware of what a nest of
gossip a country town could be, and often is. He
had experienced something of it years ago, when there
had been all that foolish talk concerning the then
Katty Fenton and himself. Once or twice he had
felt slightly uneasy lest his <i>present</i> friendship with
Katty should be misunderstood. Indeed, he had felt
this so strongly to give her what he had thought to
be a delicate hint&mdash;a hint that she had at once taken&mdash;as
to the inadvisability of her coming, when in
Pewsbury, to see him in his private room at the Bank.
She had done that rather often at one time, when she
was first his tenant at Rosedean. But now she never
came to the Bank. She did not even keep her account
at Pavely's, though it would have been a convenience
to her to do so.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Mr. Johnson's call, which at any other time would
have been a tiresome infliction, was welcome, for it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
enabled the banker to dismiss this odd, queer, unpleasant
business of the anonymous letter from his
mind for a while.</p>

<p class="indent">But after Mr. Johnson had gone, the trouble came
back, and the morning&mdash;what was left of it&mdash;seemed
very long.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked himself whether, after all, it might not
be wisest to speak of that absurd letter to some one.
Should he say anything to Mrs. Tropenell, or well,
yes&mdash;to Laura? But impatiently he shook his head
at the thought. Not only would such a thing shock
and disgust his wife, but, what was of far more consequence
to him, it might make her turn against
Tropenell! Godfrey Pavely had been pleased and
surprised at the way in which Laura had tolerated
the other man being so much about the house. In
Pavely's imagination Tropenell was <i>his</i> friend&mdash;not
Laura's.</p>

<p class="indent">He was glad when he heard a quarter to one chime
out from the Parish Church tower, for it meant that
he could now get up and go across to the Club for
luncheon. He put on his hat and went out into the
square hall of the Bank.</p>

<p class="indent">As he did so, his head clerk came down the broad
staircase.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Privet's room was only a little smaller, and a
little less lacking in dignity, than that of Mr. Pavely
himself&mdash;indeed, some people thought it a pleasanter
room, for it looked out on to the High Street, and
was on the first floor.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you'd been a minute earlier, sir," said the old
man, smiling, "you'd have seen Mrs. Pavely go by!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
I think she must have been in Mrs. Tropenell's motor,
for Mr. Tropenell was driving her himself."</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely felt a queer little pang of annoyance
and surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"I daresay they're still in the town," he said quickly.
"I thought it quite possible that they might come in
this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">But he had thought nothing of the kind.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Privet shook his head. "Oh no, sir! They
were going home sure enough&mdash;and rather quickly,
too. I thought the car <i>had</i> caught that youngest Sherlock
boy, but Mr. Tropenell's a skilful driver, and he
missed the child, but only by a few inches, as far as
I could judge!"</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely nodded, walked on, and so out and
across the High Street. He could not help feeling
a little vexed that Oliver and Laura should have
driven into Pewsbury&mdash;this morning, of all mornings.
He wondered if they often did so. It was fortunate
that nothing had happened to that stupid child. It
would have been very unpleasant for his wife to be
compelled to give evidence at an inquest....</p>

<p class="indent">He did not enjoy his luncheon as much as he was
wont to do. In a sense he was king of the old-fashioned
County Club; every member of it was either
on good terms with the prosperous banker, or desired
to be so. But try as he might he could not get that
odious, absurd, anonymous letter out of his mind!
He told himself again and again that it was thoughtless
and&mdash;and yes, unbecoming&mdash;of Laura, to drive in
and out of Pewsbury with Oliver Tropenell. Somehow
it was the sort of thing he would never have
thought his wife was likely to do. Again he wondered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
if she did it often. If yes, such conduct would
of course provide ample reason for low, vulgar gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">When, at last, Godfrey Pavely walked back across
to the Bank, he had come to the point of asking himself
whether after all it might not be best to say just
a word of caution to Laura. It need not be more
than a word&mdash;he knew her well enough to know that!
She was the kind of woman to shrink with fastidious
disgust from the thought of her name being connected,
in any vulgar silly way, with that of a man.</p>

<p class="indent">But his mind swung backwards and forwards, like
a pendulum. The possibility of his agreeable, cordial
relations with Oliver Tropenell being in any way
jarred or disturbed so upset him that, finally, he made
up his mind to say nothing to Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">At three o'clock the banker walked up to his head
clerk's room. "I think I'll go home early to-day,
Privet," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man got up from his chair. He was not
only fond, he was proud too, of his employer. Mr.
Pavely was a model banker, a model worker. He
never went home before four, and often stayed on
working till five.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good, sir. It's a fine afternoon. I often
wonder you stay as long as you do," he said, with that
queer touch of affection in his voice which Godfrey
Pavely valued perhaps more than he knew.</p>

<p class="indent">The walk home seemed much longer than usual.
Two miles and a bit? He was proud of the fact that
he could do it with ease in five minutes over the half-hour.
To-day, as a matter of fact, he walked so
quickly that he did it in twenty-seven minutes, but
he was not aware of that.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
For the first time for months, he passed by Rosedean
without as much as giving Katty a thought, and
he took a short cut into The Chase instead of going
on, up through the great park gates, as he was wont
to do. And then, as he went along one of the paths
in the walled kitchen garden, he suddenly heard his
wife's voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think that it would be best to have a mass of red
and purple just here. Last year we had blues."</p>

<p class="indent">He felt a queer, rather unreasoning, shock of relief,
of satisfaction. Laura was evidently speaking
to one of the gardeners.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as he came round the corner, he saw that the
person to whom Laura was speaking was not a gardener,
but Oliver Tropenell himself&mdash;Oliver, with a
spud in his hand, kneeling before Laura, a basket of
bulbs by his side. He was looking up eagerly&mdash;a jealous
onlooker might have said ardently&mdash;into her face.
In fact, Tropenell looked, so Godfrey Pavely told
himself with some heat, "damned absurd." But before
Godfrey came right upon the three of them&mdash;for
little Alice was flitting about behind her mother&mdash;Oliver
stood up, with the words, "Then I'd better
go and get those other bulbs, hadn't I? Will you
come too, Alice?"</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey called out "Hullo! Doing some planting?"
But his voice sounded odd to himself. Not so, however,
to the others. Laura was honestly unaware that
Godfrey was very much earlier than his wont, or, if
aware, she did not attach any importance to the fact.
Still, she felt afraid that Godfrey would interfere
with her gardening scheme, and so she shook her
head.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
As for Oliver Tropenell, no one looking at his dark,
set face could have guessed his thoughts. As a matter
of fact, he had heard Pavely's footsteps some
moments before Pavely spoke. And he had wondered,
with quick irritation, why he had come back from
Pewsbury&mdash;or Rosedean&mdash;so much earlier than usual.</p>

<p class="indent">Alice, dark-haired, rosy-cheeked, quite curiously
unlike either her father or her mother, was the only
one of the four who was still happily at ease. She
ran up to her father: "Come and see <i>my</i> garden,
father!" she cried. "I'm growing some mustard and
cress specially for you. You can take it to the Bank
in an envelope and have some for your tea!"</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl was aware, deep in her sensitive, affectionate
heart, that her father and mother were not
quite like other fathers and mothers. They were not
cosily loving together, as were the father and mother
of the two little girls with whom she sometimes went
to tea in Pewsbury, neither were they on the happy
terms of easy comradeship which even Alice knew
was usual with other children's parents.</p>

<p class="indent">But she loved her mother with a passionate, unswerving,
admiring love, and her father with a stout,
proprietary affection. For his sake, and his sake
only, she would have liked to be a boy, for then, so
she argued secretly within herself, she could be his
office boy at the Bank. Up to now she had felt for
Oliver Tropenell the easy, unquestioning liking children
give to one who comes and goes. But lately she
had become dimly aware that occasionally her mother
and Mr. Tropenell were too busy talking together to
take much heed of her, and this threw a little shadow
across her heart.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
For Godfrey Pavely there followed days full of
discomfort, unease, and rising annoyance. The whole
course of his life was changed. As he came and went
about the quiet streets of his native town, as he granted
business interviews to the townspeople, he was perpetually
asking himself if the person he was speaking
to was concerned with this odious matter, whether he
or she was among those who took his beautiful wife's
name lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">His object each afternoon was now to get home
early, and see for himself what was going on there,
and how far Laura was giving cause for low, vulgar
gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was not a child! She must know, if she
ever brought herself to think of such a thing, that
if a married woman allows a man to hang about her,
day after day, in the absence of her husband, there
is sure to be talk. Pavely regarded Tropenell's share
in the matter with a strange toleration&mdash;it was his
wife whom he blamed with an increasing severity as
the minutes, the hours, and the days went by.</p>

<p class="indent">He still went to see Katty Winslow, but no longer
as often as he had been wont to do. And when in
her company he was distrait, uncomfortable, longing
to ask if <i>she</i> thought Oliver's constant presence in his
house odd or&mdash;or peculiar. But he kept a prudent
guard over his tongue. One day Katty said something
which would have made it easy for him to speak, and
which, as a matter of fact, very nearly did cause him
to unburden his heart to her. It was a little word,
and said quite pleasantly, with, he felt sure, no ulterior
motive of any kind.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's odd," she said musingly, "to see what good
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
friends Laura has become with Oliver Tropenell!
Who would have thought that she would ever like
any man as much as she seems to like him? I suppose
it's really owing to the fact that he's in partnership
with her brother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She waited, and as he said nothing, she went on,
with a smile, "But then, for the matter of that, you're
just as fond of him as she is, aren't you? I can't
see the attraction myself, but I admit that it must be
there, for two people as unlike you and Laura are
to each other both to like him so much."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I do like Tropenell," Godfrey spoke very
decidedly. "But I can't make out why he gets on
so well with Gilbert Baynton. Gillie couldn't run
straight if he tried."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I've always understood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty looked at him curiously. She had never been
told the real story of the quarrel between the brothers-in-law,
but she was clever enough to have reached a
very shrewd notion of the truth. Baynton, so much
was clear, had done something which Pavely could
neither tolerate nor forgive. In the old days, as a
girl, Katty had met Gillie Baynton several times, and
he had struck her as a very amusing, agreeable sort
of young man.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey had let slip this opportunity of saying anything,
and afterwards, as is usually the case, he was
glad that he had kept silence. Clever and sympathetic
as she was, Katty could do nothing to help him in this
horrid, rather degrading business.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, walking into his room at the Bank one
morning, he saw on the top of the pile of his letters
another common-looking envelope marked <i>Private</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
He took it up with a sick feeling of half eager, half
shrinking, expectancy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"A sincere well-wisher wishes once more to inform
Mr. Pavely that all Pewsbury is discussing him and
his private affairs. The lady and gentleman in question
are more together than ever they were. The
other day some one who met them walking together
on the downs took them for an engaged couple."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">This second anonymous letter greatly added to
Godfrey Pavely's wretchedness and discomfort, all
the more that it was so moderately worded. It seemed
to confirm, to make certain, the fact of growing gossip
and scandal.</p>

<p class="indent">At last something happened which to a small extent
relieved the tension. Laura quietly informed him one
evening that she much wished to go away for three
days to see a friend of her childhood, who had written
and begged her to come, and to bring little Alice
with her.</p>

<p class="indent">She was surprised at the eagerness with which Godfrey
assented to her wish. In certain ways Godfrey
Pavely, from the modern point of view, was a tyrannical
husband. He very much disliked Laura's paying
visits by herself, and she had long ago given up even
suggesting that she should do so. Also, she on her
side much disliked asking him the smallest favour.</p>

<p class="indent">The day his wife left The Chase was the first happy
day Godfrey had had for three weeks. He spent
a pleasant hour with Katty; and on his arrival home
his feeling of satisfaction was increased by a note
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
from Mrs. Tropenell inviting him to come and spend
at Freshley Manor the three nights Laura was to be
away. He wrote accepting with more cordiality of
phrase than was his wont, even with so old a friend
as was Oliver's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Surely he and Oliver Tropenell, at last alone together,
could combine to put an end to this foolish,
vulgar gossip? It would be so much easier to speak
to and consult with Oliver in Laura's absence.</p>

<p class="indent">Once he had made up his mind to speak to the
other man, Pavely was able, almost, to forget the
whole hateful business. Still, he said nothing till
the second morning of his visit. Then, at breakfast,
he made a proposal.</p>

<p class="indent">"I feel as if I'd like to take this afternoon off.
Would you care for a good long walk, eh? We might
start about half-past two, have tea in Witanbury, and
be back here for dinner."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver nodded. He was at once glad and sorry that
Godfrey was so entirely unaware of the growing tide
of dislike, nay of hatred, that he felt for him. Secretive
as he was by nature, and by the life he had now
led for so long, Oliver Tropenell was yet no hypocrite.
He loathed the part fate had forced on him, that of
pretending a cordial friendship for this man whom he
so utterly despised. His mother had invited Godfrey
Pavely to stay with them for three nights without first
telling Oliver that she was thinking of doing so; and
then, when she had realised, too late, his annoyance,
she could only explain that Godfrey had always stayed
with her on the very rare occasions when Laura had
been away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Mother and son were together when Godfrey started
off on his daily walk into Pewsbury.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder what he's going to talk to you about?"
said Mrs. Tropenell a little nervously. The thought
of the coming afternoon expedition made her vaguely
uneasy.</p>

<p class="indent">"He's never at a loss for a word, though he very
seldom says anything worth hearing."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was looking with unhappy, frowning eyes
after the other man's trim, rather jaunty figure.</p>

<p class="indent">All that morning Mrs. Tropenell watched her son
with anxious fear. He wandered restlessly in and
out of the house, and though he never mentioned
Laura, his mother knew that he was missing her with
an almost agonised sense of loss.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was fighting a losing battle with himself&mdash;a
battle in which no help from outside could be of
any avail. He no longer spoke of going away; instead,
he had told his mother of his scheme for bringing
Gillie to Europe, and of sending Laura and her
brother off to Italy, for a happy little holiday. She
ventured to say that she thought that plan to be quite
out of the question. Godfrey would never allow it&mdash;he
had not forgiven Gillie, in spite of the fact that
Gillie had now "made good."</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearer three than half-past two, when the
two men started out, and they had been walking for
a full hour, with snatches of talk, and such comfortable
intervals of silence as is possible only between
intimates, when suddenly Godfrey Pavely stopped
walking.</p>

<p class="indent">Surprised, Tropenell also came to a stand. They
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
were on a stretch of lonely upland, with nothing save
a couple of birds in sight.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here, Oliver, there's something I want to
say to you! I hope you won't be offended. But
we're such good friends, you and I, that I think you'll
understand."</p>

<p class="indent">The colour rushed into Oliver Tropenell's face. He
turned and faced the other squarely, but he felt tense
with excitement, and a sense of challenge. He knew,
instinctively, that Pavely was going to say something
about Laura&mdash;Laura, and perhaps Gillie, her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said quietly. "Yes, Godfrey? What is
it? I can't imagine your saying anything to me that
would offend me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to read what's inside that," said Godfrey
in a low voice, and he handed Oliver an envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was relieved, but he looked down at the envelope
suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">"But this isn't to be opened till you're dead!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Open it now," said Godfrey roughly, "I only put
that in case I met with an accident&mdash;you'll see why
I did it, in a moment."</p>

<p class="indent">With a queer feeling of misgiving Oliver Tropenell
drew the common little sheet of notepaper out of the
envelope, and in silence read over what was written
there in those deceitful, printed characters.</p>

<p class="indent">He read it once, twice&mdash;thrice. Then he handed
the sheet of paper back, with a look of disgust and
contempt on his dark face, to the man standing by
his side.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" he exclaimed. "I don't know what you
expect me to say? If you'd had as many anonymous
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
letters as I've had in my time&mdash;they rain in Mexico&mdash;you
wouldn't give much thought to this kind of
garbage!"</p>

<p class="indent">Holding out the letter as if it were something dirty,
he handed it back to the other man.</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven't given much thought to it&mdash;&mdash;" and then
Godfrey stopped short. He felt as if some other man,
and not his sober self, were uttering the lie.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Oliver quickly, "I don't suppose you
have. But still, I can't help being rather sorry you
kept it, and&mdash;and that you showed it to me. There's
nothing to be done! I suppose it's the work of some
clerk whom you've dismissed in the last few weeks?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I've dismissed no one," said Pavely shortly. Somehow
Tropenell was not taking this disagreeable business
quite as he had meant him to take it.</p>

<p class="indent">In a rather different voice Oliver went on: "Show
me the letter again. I want to see if there's a date
to it."</p>

<p class="indent">"It arrived exactly three weeks ago to-day," said
Pavely slowly, "and it was posted in Pewsbury."</p>

<p class="indent">Light broke in on Tropenell. This, then, was why
Godfrey had taken to coming home at such odd hours,
and why he had telephoned several times from the
Bank, sending messages to Laura, and, on at least one
occasion, a message to Tropenell himself!</p>

<p class="indent">He set his lips tightly together, and a flood of bitter
wrath welled up from his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then in my place you would do nothing?" asked
Godfrey uncertainly.</p>

<p class="indent">More and more he was disappointed in the other's
attitude. He had thought Oliver would suggest something
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
which might be useful, or at any rate laugh the
matter off.</p>

<p class="indent">But Oliver only looked grim&mdash;grim and angry.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't see that you can do anything. It isn't the
sort of thing about which you would care to go to the
local police, and even if you knew who wrote that infamous
scrawl I don't see how you could take action.
We can't have Laura's name dragged into this kind
of business."</p>

<p class="indent">Then he asked in a lower voice, "Have you said
anything to her?"</p>

<p class="indent">The other shook his head. "I've no intention of
saying anything to Laura. It would distress and disgust
her very much."</p>

<p class="indent">He was glad to see that Oliver, hearing these words,
looked very much relieved.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked on a few paces, and then Godfrey exclaimed,
"There's one thing I do think, Oliver&mdash;and I
hope you won't be angry with me for saying it! It
must be admitted that you've been a great deal at
The Chase alone with Laura, and also, unfortunately,
that that sort of thing always does make talk in a
country town."</p>

<p class="indent">Tropenell turned on him sternly: "What sort of
thing?" he asked. "I swear before God that there has
never been anything in my attitude to Laura which
should give the slightest rise to comment, or afford the
basest scandalmonger excuse for a word."</p>

<p class="indent">And he believed every word of what he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that&mdash;I know that, my dear fellow!" Godfrey
put his hand out, and for a moment it lay heavily
on his friend's shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">But quickly, silently, Tropenell shook himself free
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
of the other's touch. "If you know that," he was
breathing hard now, not trying to disguise his anger,
"then why did you allude just now to the fact that
I am a good deal in your house? Does that mean
you wish that I should give up coming to The Chase?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, of course I don't mean that! You're the one
real friend I've made&mdash;well, since I got to man's estate,"
said Pavely ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything was going wrong. The conversation
was taking a turn he had never thought of or conceived
as possible. "What I mean is that Laura&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Tropenell stopped him with a passionate gesture:
"Cannot we keep Laura's name out of our discussion?"</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey stared at him, genuinely astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">"How can we keep Laura's name out of our discussion?
The whole thing centres about Laura! This
letter mentions Laura&mdash;ay, and I've had another letter,
which I hadn't meant to show you, but which on
second thoughts I should like you to see."</p>

<p class="indent">He began fumbling in another pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't want to see it!" cried Oliver. "I'd rather
not see it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"But I'd rather you saw it," said Godfrey obstinately.</p>

<p class="indent">Tropenell read the second anonymous letter through,
and then handed it back, without comment.</p>

<p class="indent">Silently they both turned about, and walked quickly,
in almost complete silence, back to Freshley. "We've
come home to tea, after all, mother," said Oliver
shortly, "we are neither of us in condition for a fifteen-mile
walk."</p>

<p class="indent">Neither man referred again to the matter which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
when they were together filled both their minds, and
on the day of Laura's return to The Chase, Oliver
Tropenell went up to town, without having seen her.
Four days later his mother received a rather cryptic
telegram: "Arriving to-night with a friend."</p>

<p class="indent">A friend? Some sure, sombre instinct told Mrs.
Tropenell that this would be Gillie Baynton.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;118]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="cap">"GODFREY can't eat me! Besides, he'll have to see
me some time. Not that I want to see anything
of the fellow&mdash;I always hated him! Still, as things
are, it's far better I should take him by surprise, in
Laura's house, than go cap in hand, and ask his leave
to see my sister."</p>

<p class="indent">It was Gilbert Baynton who was speaking, standing
with his legs a little apart, his fair head thrown back,
his hands in his pockets, early in the afternoon of the
day he and Oliver had arrived from London.</p>

<p class="indent">Mother and son were both in the room, but it was
really with Mrs. Tropenell that Baynton was having
this rather unpleasant argument. He and Tropenell
had had this all out before. Oliver had wanted Gillie
to write to his sister, but he was set on taking her
by surprise, and on stealing a march on Godfrey
Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell looked up at the man standing before
her. Gillie was two years older than her Oliver, and
she had been the first woman who had ever seen him,
for it was to her that his mother's doctor had handed
the lusty, already screaming baby. His mother had
passionately loved him&mdash;loved him and spoilt him,
and so had his rather lackadaisical father. Physically
he was a queer mixture of the two. Gillie Baynton
had his father's fair hair, grace of limb and movement,
and plainness of feature, coupled with his mother's
abounding vitality, and her charm of manner&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;119]</span>
charm, that coming-on-ness, which his beautiful
sister, born so many years later, had always lacked.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie had early begun to get into various ugly
scrapes, but as a youth he had always somehow managed
to shuffle out of them, for he was popular, and
"had a way with him," as country people say. Also
he had never been lacking in courage of a sort, and
courage carries even a rascal a long way.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, Gillie Baynton had been pretty well done for,
as far as his own country was concerned, when he
had been sent out, as a kind of forlorn hope, to Mexico
and Oliver Tropenell....</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie began speaking again: "I think I know my
worthy brother-in-law quite as well as you do, Mrs.
Tropenell. It's much better to take a man like that
by surprise, and not to give him time to think! After
all, he's <i>got</i> to let bygones be bygones."</p>

<p class="indent">And now Oliver interposed, for the first time. "Yes,
mother, as things are, I think Gillie had perhaps better
try and see Laura now, at once, before Godfrey
Pavely knows he's in England."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll go there right now."</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally, not very often, Gilbert Baynton made
use of some little phrase showing that he lived on
the other side of the Atlantic. He had changed somehow,
Mrs. Tropenell could hardly have told you how,
for he had always had a very assured manner. But
now Gillie looked what he was&mdash;a very prosperous
man of business, though scarcely an English man of
business. The long sojourn in Mexico had not altered
her Oliver at all&mdash;not, that is, as far as she could
see, but it had altered Gillie Baynton surprisingly. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span>
had roughened him, and increased his natural self-assurance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps Laura and little Alice will come back with
you to tea? Godfrey, too, if he seems in the humour
for it," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">And he nodded. "Thank you, Mrs. Tropenell.
That would be very pleasant."</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled, a good-humoured, triumphant smile, and
was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">The other two looked at each other rather doubtfully.
And then Oliver, as if answering her thought,
exclaimed, "I don't think he'll stay on at The Chase
till Pavely comes out from Pewsbury! Apart from
everything else, Gillie's a restless creature. We may
see him again within a very short time from now."</p>

<p class="indent">"But supposing he and Godfrey do meet?" asked
Mrs. Tropenell anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if they do meet, I think it's quite on the
cards there'll be a furious row. But that, after all,
would clear the air. As Gillie said just now, Godfrey
Pavely will <i>have</i> to put the past behind him. Perhaps,
once they've had it out, they'll be better friends.
There's a good deal to be said for a row sometimes,
mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said uncomfortably. "I agree, there is."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Laura was sitting in what was still known as "the
boudoir," by the household of Lawford Chase. It was
a beautiful and stately room, furnished some ninety
years ago, at the time of the marriage of Mrs. Tropenell's
grandmother. The late Mr. Pavely's tenants
had not cared to use it, for it was away from the
other living-rooms of the house, and so nothing in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
the boudoir had been disturbed or renewed when The
Chase had been prepared for the occupation of the
strangers who had lived there for fourteen years.</p>

<p class="indent">The room suited Laura, and Laura suited the room.
To-day she had had a fire lit, for it was beginning to
be chilly. Alice had gone off into Pewsbury to spend
the afternoon with two little friends, and now the mistress
of this lovely, old-world room was trying to read
a book; but soon she let the book rest open on her
lap, and she stared mournfully, hopelessly, into the
fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Things were not going well with Laura Pavely.
They had begun going ill about a month ago, just after
that&mdash;that unfortunate outburst on Oliver's part. Yet
she had felt so sure, after the talk that she and he
had had together, that they would slip back into their
old, easy relationship! And for a while, perhaps for
as long as a week, it had seemed as if they were
going to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">But then there had come a change. Godfrey had
fallen into the way of coming home early. In old
days, both before the coming to England of Oliver
Tropenell, and during the months that followed, Godfrey
had generally stayed at the Bank rather late, and
then, as often as not, he had gone in and had a chat
with Katty on his way home. Now he always came
back before five, and after his return home he and
Oliver would engage in interminable singles on the big
tennis court which had been Godfrey Pavely's one contribution
to the otherwise beautiful gardens of The
Chase.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, and especially had this been true these
last few days, Laura told herself that perhaps after
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
all, the world, the cynical shrewd world of which she
knew so little, was right, and that a close and confidential
friendship between a man and a woman is
an impossible ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day, staring into the fire with dry, unseeing eyes,
she felt miserably unhappy&mdash;too troubled and uneasy
to occupy herself in any of her usual ways. More
than had ever been the case before, life seemed to
stretch before her in a terrible, dreary, unending
monotony.</p>

<p class="indent">Something else had come to pass during the last
week, the week during which Oliver Tropenell had
been away in London, which she scarcely liked to
think of, or to make more real by dwelling on. Godfrey
had altered in his manner to her, he had become
kinder, and yes, more loverlike than he had been for
years. He hung about her, when he was at home,
indoors and out of doors. In an awkward, clumsy way
he actually tried to make himself pleasant! He had
even suggested that she should ask one or two people
to stay at The Chase. But she had protested that she
much preferred being alone, and with a shrug of the
shoulders he had given in. After all, he didn't really
care for strangers more than she did.</p>

<p class="indent">Several times during the last dreary week, he had
astonished her by talking to her of Oliver in a rather
fretful, complaining way, as if he thought it odd that
the other man was staying on in England with his
mother, instead of going back to Mexico. He had
said that he thought it strange that such a big business
as he understood Oliver Tropenell to have built
up, could run by itself. She had answered coldly,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
"You forget that my brother is there." And to that
he had made no reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie? A pang of pain thrilled through Laura's
lonely heart. Oliver had said nothing more concerning
Gillie's visit to Europe. Everything which had
happened, up to, and including, the evening when she
and Oliver had had that curious, intimate conversation
when he had promised so solemnly to be her
friend, seemed now like a bright, happy dream compared
with the drab reality of to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, in a few minutes, Godfrey would be
coming in, and she would have to rouse herself to
listen and to answer, while they had tea together in
the cedar drawing-room, for Godfrey did not care for
the boudoir.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she heard uttered in the corridor, outside
the door, the eager words, "Is Mrs. Pavely there?
You're sure? All right&mdash;I'll go straight in!" And
before she could gather her mind together, the door
opened, and her brother&mdash;the brother she had not
seen for years, but of whom she had just been thinking&mdash;walked
forward into the room, exclaiming heartily,
resonantly: "Well, Laura? Well, little girl? Here
I am again!"</p>

<p class="indent">She started up, and with a cry of welcoming, wondering
delight, threw herself into his arms, half laughing,
half crying, "Oh, Gillie&mdash;Gillie&mdash;Gillie! How
glad I am to see you! Somehow I thought we were
never going to meet again! Have you only just
come? Has Oliver Tropenell seen you? Why didn't
you wire?"</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie was as touched and flattered as it was in him
to be, for he remembered his sister as having been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
always quiet and restrained. And when they had
parted, just before he had gone out to Mexico, she
had seemed almost inanimate with&mdash;had it been vicarious?&mdash;shame
and pain.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought I'd take you by surprise." He looked
round him with a pleased, measuring look. "Nothing
altered!" he exclaimed, "and you've got a fire? That's
good! I feel it awfully cold here, I mean in England.
They haven't started fires yet, over at Freshley."</p>

<p class="indent">He repeated, "Nothing's altered&mdash;you least of all,
Laura. Why, you don't look a day older!"</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed. "I feel," she said, "a lifetime older."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't!" he cried briskly, "I feel younger. And
Godfrey?" His voice altered, becoming just a little
graver. "Time stood still with Godfrey too, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't think Godfrey's altered much&mdash;&mdash;" She
was hesitating. And then, very carefully, she added
the words, "Godfrey's quite good to me, you know,
Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well&mdash;of course he always liked you the best!"
And then he laughed, but to them both his laughter
sounded just a little hollow. "I gather that he and
Tropenell don't quite hit it off?"</p>

<p class="indent">She turned on him quickly, and he was puzzled at
the look of extreme astonishment which came over
her face. "What makes you think that?" she exclaimed.
"They're the greatest friends! Godfrey
likes Oliver Tropenell better than I thought he'd ever
like anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">And then, before Gillie Baynton could answer this,
to him, surprising statement, the door opened, and the
man of whom they were speaking stood gazing into
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
the room as if he could not believe in the reality of
the sight before him.</p>

<p class="indent">The brother and sister moved apart, and Gilbert
Baynton held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Godfrey," he exclaimed, "here I am again!
I expect Tropenell told you that I was thinking of
coming to Europe? But I can't be more than a month
in the old country&mdash;if as long&mdash;unless Tropenell goes
back leaving me behind for a bit. He did make some
such suggestion, but I think we're more likely to go
back together."</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke on, he let his hand slowly drop to his
side, for the man he was addressing had made no answering
movement of welcome, or even of greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a flood of wrath had mounted up into Godfrey
Pavely's brain when he saw Gilbert Baynton standing
there, with his arm round Laura's shoulder, that he
was fearful the words he meant to utter would never
get themselves said. He had never felt so angry before,
and the sensation had a curious physical effect
on him. He felt, as country folk so vividly put it,
"all of a tremble."</p>

<p class="indent">A curious, ominous, sinister silence fell on the room.
Laura, unconsciously, drew a little nearer to her
brother; and Godfrey, who was staring straight at
her, saw the movement, and it intensified the passion
of anger which was working in his brain as wine does
in the body.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must ask you to leave my house at once," he
said in a low voice. "I have had no reason to change
my mind as to what I said when you were last in this
house, Gilbert Baynton."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
<i>"Godfrey!"</i> There was a passionate protest and
revolt in the way Laura uttered her husband's name.</p>

<p class="indent">But her brother put up his hand. "Hush, Laura,"
he said. "It's much better I should tackle this business
alone. In fact, if you don't mind, you'd better
leave the room."</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head. "No, I mean to stay."</p>

<p class="indent">He shrugged his shoulders, and looked straight at
Godfrey Pavely. "Look here!" he exclaimed, "isn't
all this rather&mdash;well, highfaluting rot? It's quite true
that when I left here I didn't mean ever to darken
your doors again. But everything's altered now! I've
paid you back every cent of that money&mdash;it wasn't
even your money, it was my own sister's money. She
didn't mind my having it&mdash;I heard her tell you so
myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"You forged my signature to obtain it," said Godfrey.
He spoke in a very low voice, almost in a
whisper. He was the sort of man who always suspects
servants of listening at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I own I was a damned fool to do that&mdash;though
as a matter of fact you goaded me to it!
However, it's a long time ago, and I suggest that we'd
better let bygones be bygones. If I don't marry, and
I'm not a marrying man, your child will be my heiress.
Laura's my only sister, the only thing in the
world I really care for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura put her hand through his arm when she heard
him say that.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Godfrey spoke again, his voice a little
raised: "That makes no difference," he said&mdash;"I mean
your having paid the money back makes no difference.
I won't have you in my house, and if Laura considers
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
my wishes she won't see you again while you're in
England."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura said at once: "I shall not consider your
wishes, Godfrey. Of course I shall see my brother
as often as I can."</p>

<p class="indent">But Godfrey went on, still directly addressing Gilbert
Baynton, "I can't prevent Laura seeing you, if
she insists upon it. She's a grown-up woman, and I
can't turn the key on her. But she shan't see you
in <i>my</i> house. And, as far as I'm concerned, this is
the last time I'll ever set eyes on your face."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't you be so sure of that!" Gillie muttered the
words between his teeth. His fair face had turned a
deep red-brick colour, his blue eyes were blazing.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there fell on the three of them that strange,
ominous, sinister silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Gilbert Baynton turned to his sister. He actually
laughed out loud. But even Pavely noticed, with
bitter satisfaction, that the laughter sounded very
forced.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ha! ha! ha! Godfrey's not a bit changed. He's
just the same old narrow-minded, sanctimonious prig
he always was!"</p>

<p class="indent">He took Laura in his arms, and kissed her two or
three times very warmly. "Never mind, little girl,"
he said. "I shan't make trouble between you and Godfrey
for long! I shan't be in England for more than
a few days. I'm off to Paris next week."</p>

<p class="indent">He disengaged himself gently from Laura's clinging
arms, went to the door, opened it, then shut it very
quietly behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura turned away, and stared into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
Godfrey began, awkwardly, conciliatingly, "Now,
my dear Laura&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She put up her hand. "Don't speak to me," she
said, in what he felt to be a dreadful voice of aversion
and of pain. "I shall never, never forgive you for
this!"</p>

<p class="indent">He shrugged his shoulders, and went out of the
room, into the long corridor. And then he walked
quickly through it and so to the hall of the fine old
house, of which, try as he might, he never felt himself,
in any intimate sense, the master.</p>

<p class="indent">The hall was empty. Quietly he opened the front
door. Yes, Gillie had kept his word this time! He
really had gone. Pavely could see the alert, still young-looking
figure of the man whom in his mind he always
called "that scoundrel" hurrying down the carriage
road which led to the great gates of The Chase.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="cap">KATTY WINSLOW stood by her open gate. She
had wandered out there feeling restless and excited,
though she hardly knew why. During the last
fortnight she had spent many lonely hours, more lonely
hours than usual, for Godfrey Pavely came much less
often to see her than he had done in the old, easygoing
days.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, though restless, Katty was on the whole
satisfied. She thought that things were going very
much as she wished them to go. It was of course annoying
to know so little, but she was able to guess a
good deal, and she felt quite sure that the leaven was
working.</p>

<p class="indent">But the suspense and the uncertainty had got on her
nerves, and she had made up her mind to leave Rosedean
perhaps for as long as a fortnight. Two days
ago she had written to various friends who were always
glad to see her. That was why, as she stood
at the gate, she was able to tell herself that she was
waiting for the postman.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought it very probable that Godfrey Pavely
would be walking past her house about this time. A
couple of days ago he had come in for about half an
hour, but he had been dull and ill at ease, his mind
evidently full of something he was unwilling or
ashamed to tell. And she had watched him with an
amused, sympathetic curiosity, wondering how long
his cautious reticence would endure. If she had put
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
her mind to it, perhaps Katty could have made him
speak of that which filled his sore heart, but she felt
that the time was not yet ripe for words between herself
and Godfrey. She was afraid of jarring him, of
making him say something to her which both of them
afterwards might regret. No, not any words of love
to herself&mdash;of that she was not afraid&mdash;but some dogmatic
pronouncement on divorce, and perchance on
re-marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, as she stood there, glancing up and down
the lonely country road, she suddenly saw a man walking
quickly towards her&mdash;not from Pewsbury, but
from the opposite direction, which led only from The
Chase.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty's bright brown eyes were very good eyes, and
long before the stranger could see her she had, as it
were, taken stock of him. Somehow his clothes were
not English-looking, and he wore a kind of grey Homburg
hat.</p>

<p class="indent">He was walking at a great pace, and as he came
nearer, some vague feeling of curiosity made Katty
step out of the gate, and look straight up the road
towards him. All at once she made up her mind that
he was American&mdash;a well-to-do and, according to his
lights, a well-dressed American.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Katty Winslow looked very charming, as she
stood out there, in her heather-mixture tweed skirt,
and pale blue flannel blouse&mdash;charming, and also
young. And the stranger&mdash;to her he seemed entirely
a stranger&mdash;when he was quite close up to her, suddenly
took off his hat and exclaimed, "Why, Miss
Fenton! It is Miss Fenton, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent">He was now smiling broadly into her face, his bold,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
rather challenging eyes&mdash;the blue eyes which were the
best feature of his face, and the only feature which
recalled his beautiful sister&mdash;full of cordial admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't remember me?" he went on. "Well,
that's quite natural, for of course you made a much
deeper impression on me than I did on you!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then all at once it flashed across Katty who
this pleasant, bright-eyed wayfarer must be. It must
be, it could only be, Gilbert Baynton&mdash;the peccant
Gillie!</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Baynton?" she said questioningly, and she
also threw a great note of welcome and cordiality into
her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said. "Gilbert Baynton&mdash;very much at
your service&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;Mrs. Winslow," she said hurriedly. "I'm Mrs.
Winslow now." She saw that the name conveyed
nothing to him. "Do come in," she went on pleasantly,
"if only for a moment, Mr. Baynton. Though
it's early for tea, perhaps you'll stay and have a cup
with me? I had no idea you were in England! I
suppose you're staying with Laura, at The Chase?"</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head, the smile faded from his face,
and Katty, who was observant, saw that her question
was ill-timed.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's delightful&mdash;seeing an old friend again, and
I was feeling so bored&mdash;all by myself!"</p>

<p class="indent">As he followed her into the house, Gillie told himself
that this was distinctly amusing&mdash;quite good fun!
It would take the horrible taste of his interview with
that&mdash;that <i>brute</i>&mdash;out of his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked round the little hall with quick interest
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
and curiosity. There was no sign of a man about,
only a lady's slender walking-stick and a bright red
parasol, in the umbrella-stand. Was pretty little Katty
a widow? Somehow she did not look like a widow!</p>

<p class="indent">She opened a door which gave out of the hall on
the left, and called out, "Harber? I should like tea
in about five minutes."</p>

<p class="indent">Then she shut the door, and led the way down the
little hall, and through into her sitting-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie again glanced about him with eager appreciation.
This was the sort of room he liked&mdash;cosy,
comfortable, bright and smiling like its attractive mistress.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sit down," she exclaimed, "and tell me everything
that's happened to you since we last met! Why, it
must be, let me see, quite twelve years ago?"</p>

<p class="indent">She took up a china box: "Have a cigarette&mdash;I'll
have one too."</p>

<p class="indent">He waved the box aside, took out his own case, and
held it out to her. "I think you'll like these," he said.
Then he struck a match, and as their fingers touched,
the lighting of her cigarette took quite a little while.</p>

<p class="indent">"This <i>is</i> jolly!" He sank back into one of Katty's
well-cushioned easy chairs. "You've the prettiest
room I've been in since I came to England, Mrs.
Winslow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then you haven't been into Laura's boudoir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I've just come from there." Again his face
altered as he spoke, and this time there came a look
of frowning anger over it. Then, almost as if he
read the unspoken question in her mind, he said slowly,
"Look here, Mrs. Winslow, as you seem to know my
sister so well, I may as well tell you the truth. I've
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
just been ordered out of her house by my brother-in-law,
Godfrey Pavely. I suppose you know that he
and I had a row years ago?" He was looking at her
rather hard as he spoke, and she nodded her head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said frankly, "I do know that, though
I don't know what it was about."</p>

<p class="indent">He breathed a little more freely. "It was about
money," he said bitterly. "Just what one would expect
it to be with a man like Godfrey. He was furious
because I got Laura to lend me some money. It
was to pay a debt of honour, for I was a gambler in
those days. But I'm a good boy now!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said, and smiled. "I know you are!
You're Oliver Tropenell's partner, aren't you, Mr.
Baynton? He talks awfully nicely of you."</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie&mdash;his face was fair, his skin very clear, almost
like a girl's&mdash;looked pleased. "Good old Tropenell!"
he exclaimed. "Yes, he and I are tremendous pals.
He's been the best friend to me man ever had."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am <i>so</i> sorry for Laura," said Katty gently.</p>

<p class="indent">She was playing with the edge of a piece of Italian
embroidery which covered a small table close to her
elbow, and she was thinking&mdash;hard.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment the drawing-room door opened, and
the tea appeared. While the table was being drawn
up in front of her, the tray placed on to it, and a
taper put to the spirit lamp, Katty's mind went on
working busily. And by the time the maid was leaving
the room, she had come to a decision. Even to
her it was a momentous decision&mdash;how momentous to
others she was destined never to know.</p>

<p class="indent">Again she said slowly, impressively, "Yes, Mr.
Baynton, I am sorry indeed for poor Laura."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
"I'm sorry too. Not that it much matters! I didn't
want to stay at The Chase. I always thought it a
gloomy place in the old days, when I was a child&mdash;I
mean when it still belonged to Mrs. Tropenell's people.
Of course I shall see Laura again&mdash;Godfrey can't
prevent that! In fact he admitted that he couldn't."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little pause. And then Katty, her
eyes bent downwards, said, "I didn't quite mean that,
Mr. Baynton. Of course I'm very sorry about your
new row with Mr. Pavely, for it must be so hateful
to Laura to feel she can't have her own brother in
her own house. But&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;" She threw her head
back, and gazed straight across at him. "Can you
keep a secret?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course I can!" He looked at her amused.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to keep what I'm going to say absolutely
to yourself. I don't want you ever to hint a
word of it to Laura&mdash;still less to Oliver Tropenell."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I won't!" He looked at her with growing
curiosity. What was it she was going to tell
him?</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder if I ought to tell you," she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed outright. "Well, I can't <i>make</i> you tell
me!"</p>

<p class="indent">She felt piqued at his indifference. "Yes, I will
tell you, though it isn't <i>my</i> secret!" she exclaimed.
"But I feel that you ought to know it&mdash;being Laura's
brother. Laura," her voice dropped, she spoke in a
very low voice, "Laura is in love with Oliver Tropenell,
Mr. Baynton. And Oliver is in love with Laura&mdash;a
thousand times more in love with her than she is
in love with him!"</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him a swift glance across the tea-table.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Yes! Her shot had told indeed. He looked extraordinarily
moved and excited. So excited that he got
up from his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good God!" he exclaimed incredulously. "Laura?"
And then, "Tropenell? Are you sure of this, Mrs.
Winslow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she answered in a quiet, composed voice that
carried conviction. "I am <i>quite</i> sure. They are both
very, very unhappy, for they are good, high-minded
people. They wouldn't do anything wrong for the
world."</p>

<p class="indent">As he looked at her a little oddly, and with a queer
little smile all over his face, she exclaimed, "I <i>know</i>
Laura wouldn't." And he nodded, a little ashamed
of that queer little smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Gilbert Baynton's face stiffened into deep gravity.
His eyes were shining, and he was staring down at
the little table, his half-finished cup of tea forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down again. "Has Laura told you this?"
he asked abruptly. "Are you her confidante?"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty hesitated. "No," she said at last. "I don't
suppose Laura has spoken of the matter to any living
soul. But if you promise absolutely not to give me
away&mdash;I can tell you how you can assure yourself of
the truth. Ask Mrs. Tropenell. <i>She</i> knows. I won't
say any more."</p>

<p class="indent">"And Pavely?" he asked. "What part does my
fine brother-in-law play? Does proper Godfrey know?
Is priggish Godfrey jealous?"</p>

<p class="indent">She answered slowly: "I think that Mr. Pavely suspects.
He and Oliver Tropenell were great friends
till quite lately. But there's a coldness now. I don't
know what happened. But <i>something</i> happened."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
"I see now why Tropenell has stayed here so long.
I thought it must be a woman! I thought some prudish,
dull, English girl had got hold of him&mdash;&mdash;" He
waited a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I'm eternally grateful to you, Mrs. Winslow,
for giving me this hint! You see, I'm very fond of
Tropenell. It's a peculiar kind of feeling&mdash;there's
nothing in the world I wouldn't do for him. Good
God! I only wish that he and Laura&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He was going to say "would have the pluck to bolt
together!" but Katty supplied a very different ending
to his sentence.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah," she exclaimed, "I only wish that Laura and
Oliver <i>could</i> marry. They're made for one another.
You can't see them together without seeing that!"
She went on feelingly, "Laura was dreadfully unhappy
with Godfrey Pavely even before Oliver Tropenell
came into her life. She and Mr. Pavely are quite
unsuited to one another."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a queer bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Gillie Baynton suddenly remembered&mdash;remembered
the flood of gossip there had been at one
time concerning those two&mdash;pretty Katty Fenton, as
she had been then, and Godfrey Pavely, the man who
later became his own brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="indent">He gave her a queer, shrewd glance, and Mrs.
Winslow went on, rather quickly and breathlessly,</p>

<p class="indent">"You mustn't think that I dislike Godfrey Pavely!
He's been very good to me&mdash;as good as Laura. I'm
what they call an innocent <i>divorce</i>, Mr. Baynton,
and they both helped me through the trouble. It was
pretty bad at the time, I can tell you. But of course
I can't help seeing&mdash;no one could help seeing&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Godfrey and Laura aren't suited to one another, and
that they would each be much, much happier apart."</p>

<p class="indent">At the back of her clever, astute mind was the
knowledge that it was quite on the cards that Oliver,
or Oliver's mother, would say something to Gilbert
Baynton concerning herself and her intimacy with Godfrey
Pavely. She must guard against that, and guard
against it now.</p>

<p class="indent">So she went on, pensively, "I don't know, to tell
you the truth, for which of them I'm the more sorry&mdash;Laura,
Godfrey, or Oliver! They're all three awfully
to be pitied. Of course, if they lived in America
it would be quite simple; Laura and Godfrey would
be divorced by mutual consent, and then Laura would
be able to be happy with Mr. Tropenell."</p>

<p class="indent">"And is nothing of that sort possible here?" asked
Gillie Baynton curiously. "This old England <i>has</i>
stood still!"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty shook her head regretfully. "No, there's
nothing of the sort possible here. Of course there
are ways and means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The other fixed his eyes on her. "Yes?" he said
interrogatively.</p>

<p class="indent">"I fear that they are not ways and means that Godfrey
or Laura would ever lend themselves to."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then there's no cutting the Gordian knot?"</p>

<p class="indent">But that wasn't quite what Katty meant to imply.
"I don't know," she said hesitatingly. "Godfrey
would do almost anything to avoid any kind of
scandal. But then you see one comes up against
Laura&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded quickly. "Yes, I quite understand that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
Laura would never do anything she thought wrong&mdash;queer,
isn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Gilbert Baynton stayed on at Rosedean for quite
another half-hour, but nothing more was said on the
subject which was filling his mind and that of his
hostess. They walked about the pretty, miniature garden,
talking in a desultory way over old times, and
about some of the people they had both known years
ago.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, at last, she took him to the gate. They
looked at one another like two augurs, and he said
under his breath, "Well, it's a pretty kettle of fish I've
come home to, eh? I thought there was some sort of
mystery. I'm very much obliged to you for having
put me on the track to solve the riddle."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah," she said, "but the riddle isn't solved yet, Mr.
Baynton, is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">He answered, gravely for him, "No, those sorts of
riddles are very hard to solve." He hesitated, then
exclaimed in a meaning tone, "Still, they <i>are</i> solved
sometimes, Mrs. Winslow."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was late the same night, a warm, St. Martin's
summer night, and Mrs. Tropenell, sitting alone after
dinner, made an excuse of a telephone message to join
her son and Gillie Baynton out of doors.</p>

<p class="indent">After Baynton's return from The Chase the two
men had gone off for a long walk together over the
downs, and they had come home so late that dinner
had had to be put off for half an hour. Instead of
joining her later, they had gone out again, but this
time only into the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">Noiselessly she moved across the grass, and then,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
just as she was going to step under the still leaf-draped
pergola, she heard her son's voice&mdash;a voice so charged
with emotion and pain that, mastered by her anxiety,
she stopped just behind one of the brick arches, and
listened.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll oblige me, Baynton, by keeping your sister's
name out of this."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, very well! I thought you'd be glad to know
what that woman said to me&mdash;I mean Mrs. Winslow."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm not glad. I'm sorry. Mrs. Winslow is mistaken."</p>

<p class="indent">The short sentence came out with laboured breath
as if with difficulty, and the one who overheard them,
the anguished eavesdropper, felt her heart stirred with
bitter impotence.</p>

<p class="indent">How Oliver cared&mdash;how much Oliver cared!</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are you so sure of that?" Again she heard
Baynton's full, caressing voice. "Laura's a very reserved
woman! I'd rather believe her best friend&mdash;apparently
Katty <i>is</i> her best friend&mdash;about such a
thing as this. You've admitted that <i>you</i> love her."</p>

<p class="indent">And as the other made no answer, Gillie went on,
speaking in a very low voice, but with every word
clearly audible from the place where Mrs. Tropenell
stood listening: "Of course I won't mention Laura&mdash;as
it upsets you so much! But after all, my hatred
for Pavely and my love for my sister are the two
strongest things in my life. Surely you know that
well enough, Tropenell? I can't bar Laura out!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then came the answer, muttered between the
speaker's teeth: "I understand that, Baynton."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry I repeated Mrs. Winslow's tale. But of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
course it did impress me&mdash;it did influence me. I'd
<i>like</i> to believe it, Tropenell."</p>

<p class="indent">The secret listener was surprised at the feeling
which Gillie's vibrant voice betrayed.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver muttered something&mdash;was it, "I'd give my
soul to know it true"?</p>

<p class="indent">Then, in a lighter tone, Gillie exclaimed, "As to
that other matter, I'd rather keep you out of the business
altogether if I could! But I can't&mdash;quite."</p>

<p class="indent">What was it that Oliver answered then? The two
men were now walking slowly away towards the further
end of the pergola. Mrs. Tropenell strained her
ears to hear her son's answer:</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't want to keep out of it." Was that what
he said, in a very low, tense voice?</p>

<p class="indent">Gilbert Baynton was speaking again: "It is <i>my</i> idea,
<i>my</i> scheme, and I mean to carry it through! I shan't
want much help&mdash;only quite a little help from you."</p>

<p class="indent">And then she heard her son's voice again, and he
was speaking more naturally this time. "Of course
we'll go shares, Gillie! What d'you take me for?
Am I to have all the profit, and you all the risk?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell breathed more freely. They were
off from Laura now, and on some business affair. She
heard Gillie Baynton laugh aloud. "I'm quite looking
forward to it&mdash;but it will be a longish job!"</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver answered, "<i>I'm</i> not looking forward to it.
You feel quite sure about this thing, Baynton? There's
time to draw back&mdash;now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure? Of course I'm sure!" There was triumph,
a challenge to fate, in the other's tone. "I've always
liked playing for high stakes&mdash;you know that, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, I know that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;141]</span>
"And I've never looked back. I've never regretted
anything I've done in my life&mdash;&mdash;" there was a ring
of boastful assurance in Gilbert Baynton's tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can't say that of myself&mdash;I wish I could."</p>

<p class="indent">"You? Why, you've a milk-white record, compared
to mine!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell moved away swiftly over the grass,
till she stood at the end of the dark, arched walk.
Then, "Oliver!" she called out, "there's a message
from Lord St. Amant. He wants to know if you can
go over to the Abbey next week, from Saturday till
Tuesday. He says there'll be some shooting. I told
him you'd ring up before going to bed&mdash;I hope that
was right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, mother. Of course I'll ring up. I'll go in
and do it now, if you like. Gillie and I have been
having a long business talk."</p>

<p class="indent">And then she heard Gilbert Baynton: "I'll stay out
here a bit longer, Mrs. Tropenell. I'm getting quite
used to the cold and damp of the old country. I don't
mind it as much as I did a week ago."</p>

<p class="indent">Mother and son walked across the lawn to the
house.</p>

<p class="indent">When they were indoors, he broke silence first:
"Gillie had a bad row with Pavely this afternoon.
I don't think it's any use his staying on here. Pavely
won't allow Laura to see him again at The Chase."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, it's unfortunate, I admit. And I don't think
it was Gillie's fault! He's described the scene to me
in great detail. He was quite willing to go as far as
I think he could be expected to go in the way of apology
and contrition. But Pavely simply didn't give
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
him a chance. Pavely's a narrow-minded brute,
mother."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is Gillie very upset? Is he much disappointed?"
she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I think Gillie is upset&mdash;more upset than I
should have expected him to be! He's disappointed,
too, at not having seen little Alice. He's really fond
of children, and, as he truly says, Alice is bound to
be his heiress&mdash;unless of course he should marry,
which is very unlikely."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was speaking in a preoccupied, absent voice,
as if he was hardly thinking of what he was saying.
"We're thinking, he and I, of going to the Continent
next week. We've got business to do in Paris&mdash;rather
important business, too. Of course I'll try and come
back here before leaving for Mexico."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell felt as if the walls of the room were
falling about her. Oliver had always spoken of late
as if he meant to stay on in England till after Christmas.</p>

<p class="indent">"How long d'you expect to be in France?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can't tell yet, mother. I might be there a fortnight,
or I might be there six weeks&mdash;it all depends
on the business we're going to do. No dates are settled
yet."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a few moments, then said slowly, "I've
been wondering whether you would mind going up
with Laura to London for a few days? Somehow I
think Pavely is more likely to let her go if you offer
to go too."</p>

<p class="indent">There swept over her a feeling of recoil, but she
let her son see nothing of that. "Very well," she
said quietly. "I quite understand&mdash;I'll do my best.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
I agree that Laura ought to see her brother again.
And what are <i>you</i> thinking of doing, my dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I thought of going up to town, too." He
spoke with a detached air. "You and I could stay in
that nice little hotel where we stayed years ago, mother.
Of course I'm only thinking of a few days in town,
before Gillie and I go off to Paris."</p>

<p class="indent">As they came through into the house, she was startled
by the expression on her son's face. He looked
as if he had had a shock; he was very pale, it was as
if all the healthy colour had been drained out of his
tan cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver?" she exclaimed. "Do you feel ill, my
darling? When you came in before dinner you looked
as if you had caught a chill."</p>

<p class="indent">"It was rather cold on the downs, but I feel very
much as usual, thank you, mother. A talk with Gillie
always tires me. I think he's got a rather&mdash;&mdash;" he
hesitated for a word, then found it&mdash;"obstreperous
vitality."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="cap">WHEN Godfrey Pavely arrived at the Bank next
morning it seemed to him that days, instead of
hours, had gone by, since that hateful and degrading
scene had taken place between himself and his wife's
brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura had not spoken to him again, except to utter
the few sentences which were necessary to keep up the
pretence that they two were on their usual terms, before
the servants, and, what had been more difficult,
before their little daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">After Alice had gone to bed, they had eaten their
dinner in silence, and, in silence also, they had spent
the evening reading up to eleven o'clock. At last Godfrey,
getting up, had said in a nervous, conciliatory
tone, "Well, good-night, Laura." But she had not
answered him, for by that time the servants were gone
to bed, and there was no longer any reason for hypocrisy.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura had always been an exceptionally silent
woman, but this was the first time, in the long armed
neutrality of their married life, that she had actually
refused to answer when he spoke to her. Feeling
acutely uncomfortable, because curiously helpless,
Godfrey Pavely now wondered how long this state of
things was to endure.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked himself whether he had said anything
yesterday which could really justify Laura in this extraordinary
attitude. Now and again there seemed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
to sound in his ears the voice in which she had uttered
the last words which she had spoken to him of
her own free will. "Don't speak to me," she had exclaimed
passionately. "I shall never, never forgive
you for this!"</p>

<p class="indent">Women were so unreasonable&mdash;ridiculously, absurdly
unreasonable. Laura knew exactly what Gillie
was like, for he, Godfrey, had gone to special pains
to make Laura fully understand the mean, despicable
and <i>dangerous</i> way in which her brother had behaved
over the forged cheque&mdash;for forgery it was, though
it had been difficult to persuade Laura of the fact.
He remembered now, how, at last, after he had forced
his wife to understand, she had abased herself, imploring
him to save her brother from the consequences
of his wicked action.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey also remembered sorely how grateful
Laura had seemed to be after everything had been
arranged, and Gillie had finally gone off to Mexico, a
ruined and discredited man. He felt a glow of virtuous
satisfaction when he recalled how she had
thanked him&mdash;her kind, generous husband&mdash;for what
he had done! True, the loan then advanced had been
paid back, and Gillie&mdash;to use the stupid expression
which seems to be creeping into the British language&mdash;had
"made good." But that was no reason why
he should come back and thrust himself into his, Godfrey's,
home, and make friends with Godfrey's only
child&mdash;after he had actually given an undertaking, in
his own, melodramatic words, "never to darken Godfrey's
door again."</p>

<p class="indent">Yet in his innermost heart Godfrey Pavely was
sorry now that he had behaved as he had done yesterday.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
He had allowed his temper to get the better
of him, always a silly thing for a sensible man to do.
By behaving as he had done he had put a weapon into
Laura's hands....</p>

<p class="indent">At one moment he considered the advisability of
going into Freshley Manor on his way home to-day,
to consult Mrs. Tropenell. And then he had suddenly
remembered that his brother-in-law was actually her
guest! That fact alone made a most disagreeable
complication.</p>

<p class="indent">As he looked over his letters, and dictated some of
the answers to them, he tried without success to put
the matter out of his mind. It had taken there the
place occupied by the unpleasantness connected with
those absurd anonymous letters. For the first time,
this morning he forgot them.</p>

<p class="indent">There came a knock at the door. "A letter, sir,
has just been brought by Mrs. Tropenell's man. He
said there was an answer, so he's waiting."</p>

<p class="indent">With quickened pulse, Godfrey Pavely opened the
letter. He had long been familiar with Mrs. Tropenell's
clear, flowing handwriting, and he wondered
what she could have to say to him which she preferred
to write, rather than telephone.</p>

<p class="indent">The banker was attached to Mrs. Tropenell. Always
she had acted towards him in a high-minded,
straightforward way, and on two occasions he had
had reason to be specially grateful to her, for on each
of these occasions she had intervened, successfully,
between Laura and himself, and made Laura see reason.
But she never alluded to the past, even in the
remotest way, and he had come of late years to think
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
and hope she had forgotten those now distant, painful,
active misunderstandings.</p>

<p class="indent">If Mrs. Tropenell was now pleading with him for a
reconciliation with Gilbert Baynton, then he knew that
it would be very difficult for him to say "no" to a
woman to whom he owed so much. It would also
be a graceful way of getting out of the difficulty in
which he had involved himself....</p>

<p class="indent">But the contents of the letter disagreeably surprised
him, for they were quite other than what he had expected
them to be&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Dear Godfrey</span>:&mdash;Oliver and Gilbert Baynton have
to go to the Continent on business. I think they will
be away for some time, and Gilbert speaks of going
straight back to Mexico from France.</p>

<p class="indent">"I write to know if you will allow Laura to come
up to town with me for a few days? It would enable
her to see something of her brother, before a separation
which may last, as did their past separation, for
years.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope, dear Godfrey, you will see your way to
granting this request of mine. It is in very truth my
request&mdash;not Laura's.</p>

<p class="margin-left8">"Your affectionate old friend,</p>

<p class="margin-left16">"<span class="smcap">Lettice Tropenell</span>."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The unfortunate man&mdash;for he was in the full meaning
of the words an unfortunate man&mdash;stared down
at the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt moved and perplexed by the way it was
worded. "Your affectionate old friend"&mdash;what a
strange way to sign herself! Mrs. Tropenell had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
never signed herself so before. And what exactly
did she mean by saying that it was her request, not
Laura's? In spite of those words, he felt convinced
that Laura, too proud to ask this favour of him after
the shameful way she had behaved yesterday, had
persuaded Mrs. Tropenell to ask it for her.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down and drew a piece of notepaper towards
him. He was glad of the opportunity of showing
them all how magnanimous he was&mdash;how much
of a <i>man</i>. Laura should go to London with his full
permission. Of course he knew quite well, at the back
of his mind, that if he refused it she would probably
go just the same. But in all the circumstances it
would be just as well to heap coals of fire on her
head. She should go&mdash;but not taking their child with
her. His little Alice must not be contaminated.</p>

<p class="indent">When his daughter was old enough, he, Godfrey,
would tell her the truth about her mother's brother.
He did not hold with concealing this sort of thing
from young people. In <i>his</i> family, thank God, there
had never been anything to hide. All had always been
honest and above-board. Besides, if anything happened
to him, Alice would be a very wealthy woman,
and Gillie would almost certainly try and get hold of
her and of her money. He, Godfrey, knew that well
enough.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Tropenell</span>:&mdash;Certainly it shall
be as you ask&mdash;&mdash;" He could not help adding,
"though Laura knows that in doing this she is disregarding
my formal wishes. Still, I admit that,
Gillie being her brother, it is, I suppose, natural that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
she should wish to see him again before he leaves
England."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then he hesitated&mdash;indeed, he kept the messenger
for whom he had already rung waiting for quite a
long time. But at last he signed himself: "Your affectionate,
and always grateful, Godfrey Pavely."</p>

<p class="indent">When the banker reached home rather early that
afternoon&mdash;for he felt too much upset to go in and
spend his usual pleasant hour with Katty at Rosedean&mdash;little
Alice met him with the news that "Mummy"
had gone to London, and that she, Alice, was going
to be allowed to sit up to dinner to bear him company.</p>

<p class="indent">It was characteristic of the man that, if relieved, he
was also sharply annoyed. He had hoped to extract
from his wife some word of reluctant thanks for his
magnanimity. But no, she had not even left a note
telling him what day she would return!</p>

<p class="indent">Things had not fallen out at The Chase that morning
as Godfrey Pavely had supposed. After breakfast
Laura, still in a kind of stupor of pain and indignation,
had gone into the garden. She had not been there
a quarter of an hour when Mrs. Tropenell, who so
seldom came to The Chase, had suddenly appeared,
walking with stately, leisurely steps over the grass, to
tell her of Oliver's and Gillie's coming departure for
the Continent.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Mrs. Tropenell who had proposed sending
that note to Godfrey, but Godfrey, who so little understood
his wife, either for good or evil, was right
in his belief that she would not have allowed her plans
to be affected by his answer. At once Laura had determined
to go to London, whether Godfrey gave his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
consent or no. Yet she was relieved when there came
to her from Freshley the news that her husband's answer
to Mrs. Tropenell's request was in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="indent">The message was given to her over the telephone
by Oliver Tropenell, and in giving it he used the allusive
form of words which come naturally when a man
knows that what he says may be overheard: "Mother
has just had a note saying that it is quite all right. So
we propose to call for you in time to get the five minutes
to one from Langford Junction. Does that give
you enough time?" And she had exclaimed, "Oh,
yes, yes! I'm quite ready now."</p>

<p class="indent">To that he had made no answer, and she had felt
a little chill at the heart. Oliver's voice had sounded
curiously cold&mdash;but then the telephone does sometimes
alter voices strangely.</p>

<p class="indent">Those eight days in London! Laura was often to
live through each of those long days during the dull
weeks which followed her return home. Yet, when
she did look back on that time, she had to admit that
she had not been really happy, though the first hours
had been filled with a sort of excited triumph and
sense of victory. It was such a relief, too, to be away
from Godfrey, and spared, even if only for a few
days, the constant, painful irritation of his presence.</p>

<p class="indent">But her brother, for whose sake, after all, she was
in London, jarred on her perpetually. For one thing,
Gillie was in extravagant, almost unnaturally high
spirits, set on what he called "having a good time,"
and his idea of a good time was, as Oliver once grimly
remarked, slightly monotonous.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie's good time consisted in an eager round of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
business interviews, culminating each evening in a
rich dinner at one of the smart grill-rooms which were
then the fashion, followed by three hours of a musical
comedy, and finally supper at some restaurant, the
more expensive the better.</p>

<p class="indent">To his sister, each evening so spent seemed a dreary
waste of precious time. For in the daytime the two
ladies, who had taken rooms in an old-fashioned hotel
in a small street off Piccadilly, saw very little of Gillie
and Oliver. Gillie had insisted that Oliver and he
should go and stay at what he considered the smartest
and most modern hotel in London, and though the
strangely assorted quartette always lunched together,
the two partners had a good deal to do each morning
and most afternoons.</p>

<p class="indent">To Mrs. Tropenell's surprise Oliver apparently had
no wish to be with Laura alone. Was it because he
was afraid of giving himself away to his coarse-minded,
jovial partner? Oliver looked stern, abstracted,
and, when at the play, bored.</p>

<p class="indent">She admitted another possible reason for his almost
scrupulous avoidance of Laura. With regard to the
bitter feud between the brothers-in-law, Oliver had
spoken to his mother with curious apathy. Perhaps
he was honestly desirous of not taking sides. But on
the whole Mrs. Tropenell swung more often to her
first theory, and this view was curiously confirmed on
the one Sunday spent by them in town.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie, grumbling, a good deal at the dulness of the
English Sunday, had motored off early to the country
to spend the day with some people whom he had known
in Mexico. And late that morning Oliver suddenly
suggested that Laura and he should go out for a turn
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
in the Green Park&mdash;only a stone's-throw from the
rooms the two ladies were sharing.</p>

<p class="indent">And that hour, which was perhaps fraught with
bigger circumstance than any one, save Oliver himself,
was ever to know, did remain in Laura Pavely's
memory as a strange and, in a sense, a delicious oasis,
in her long, arid stay in London. For, as the two
walked and talked intimately together in a solitude all
the greater because peopled by the indifferent and unknown,
they seemed to come nearer to one another&mdash;and
to meet, for the first time, in an atmosphere
of clarity and truth. Laura, perhaps because she had
felt, during these last few days, so desperately lonely
in a spiritual sense, talked more freely, albeit in a
more detached way, to her devoted, considerate, and
selfless friend, than she had ever been able to bring
herself to do to any other human being.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">For a while, after they had turned and begun pacing
together under the now yellowing plane trees, neither
of them spoke. Then Oliver said abruptly, "So all
our schemes have vanished into air&mdash;I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry too," she said. "I always knew that
Godfrey would never allow me to go away with Gillie,
but I never, never thought that even he could behave
as he did to my brother the other day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sound of suppressed passion and revolt
in her voice that he had never heard there before.
It touched a chord in his own heart, but all he said,
slowly, was, "I suppose Gillie irritated him."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I don't think so. There wasn't time for Gillie
to do anything, for Godfrey at once refused to shake
hands with him. That's how it began."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
"Gillie ought to have written first. My mother
begged him not to take Godfrey by surprise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your mother is always right," she said in a low
voice. "I've never known her wrong yet, though her
advice isn't always easy to follow, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm afraid she was right this time, anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know she was."</p>

<p class="indent">There fell between them a long, pregnant silence.
And then Oliver said, in a low, moved voice, "I'm
afraid that this last business has made you very unhappy,
Laura?"</p>

<p class="indent">She answered, "Yes&mdash;foolishly so. I ought not to
have been surprised, for by this time I know Godfrey
so well." And she believed herself to be speaking the
truth.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not his fault," she went on painfully, "that he
has nothing in common with me and with my brother,
different as we, too, are the one from the other. Gillie
and I might have been born on different planets from
Godfrey."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura had not meant to speak of Godfrey to Oliver.
Indeed, she had formed the resolution never to
do so again. But somehow, to-day, she felt as if she
might break that salutary rule.</p>

<p class="indent">His next words seemed to prove to her that she
could trust him to understand, for, "Yes," he said
quietly, "you're right there, Laura. You and Godfrey
have nothing in common between you, and that being
so, I suppose there's nothing to be done?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, there's nothing to be done," she repeated hopelessly.
And then once more she broke her wise resolution:
"If it hadn't been for Alice, I should, even
now, be tempted to do what I so nearly did at the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
time that Godfrey and Gillie"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"had
their first misunderstanding."</p>

<p class="indent">"What you nearly did then, Laura?" There came
an eager, questioning thrill in her companion's strained
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;" Why shouldn't she unburden her heart
for once? "Yes, at the time of that first quarrel between
my brother and my husband, I nearly left Godfrey.
But for your mother, I should have done so.
Alice was a tiny baby then, and I didn't realise, as I
realise now, what an awful responsibility a woman
takes on herself in breaking up a child's happy home.
Only your mother stopped my doing it, and the fact"&mdash;she
looked at him with a soundless depth of sadness
in her face&mdash;"the fact that Gillie didn't really want
me to go and live with him. Of course it was long
before the question of his going to Mexico was
raised."</p>

<p class="indent">"And have you never regretted that you did not
carry out that purpose?"</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell was looking straight before him
as he asked the dangerous question. They were walking,
slowly, slowly, along the broad path which runs
just within the railings along the park side of Piccadilly.
Between twelve and one on an autumn Sunday
morning this path is generally deserted.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer at once, and he said quickly,
"Forgive me! I ought not to have asked you that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said again, "you can ask me anything
you like, Oliver. But it's very difficult to answer such
a question truthfully."</p>

<p class="indent">And again there fell between them one of those
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
long silences which played a curious part in a conversation
neither ever forgot.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Laura did answer Oliver's dangerous question.
"I have always known in my heart that your
mother was right in making me do what she did&mdash;I
mean in persuading me that for my little girl's sake
I must go on. Alice loves her father, though I think,
perhaps foolishly, that of the two she cares for me
best&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course she does!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"But whether that be so or not, I know what a terrible
thing it would have been for Alice if Godfrey
and I had lived apart. I've never doubted that&mdash;I
don't doubt it now. But for that I could not go on&mdash;after
what happened the other day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then if, as is of course possible, you and I don't
meet again for years and years, am I to think of you
as always going on in exactly the same way?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Some cruel devil outside himself had seemed to
force him to utter the hopeless question which he had
already made up his mind should be, must be, answered
by Fate in the negative.</p>

<p class="indent">They had stopped their slow pacing side by side,
and he was now looking down into her sad, desolate
eyes. He saw the word&mdash;the one word "Yes," form
itself on her quivering lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you really mean that, Laura? Answer me
truly."</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly there came over Laura Pavely
an extraordinary sensation. It was as if this man,
whose burning eyes were fixed on her face, were willing
her to say aloud something which, however true,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
were better left unsaid. "There will never come any
change," she answered, feeling as if the words were
being forced out of her, "till, as the Marriage Service
says, 'death us do part.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you ever think of that possibility?"</p>

<p class="indent">He put the probing question in a singularly detached,
almost a light, tone of inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">But she answered very solemnly, again as if impelled
to tell him the truth&mdash;a truth she had never
thought to tell to any human being:</p>

<p class="indent">"There was a time before Alice was born when
I was so unhappy, largely, as I can see now, through
my own fault, when I felt I could not bear it any
longer, and&mdash;&mdash;" Her voice dropped, and he bent
down so that he might catch the almost whispered
words, "I was strongly tempted to&mdash;to kill myself,"
she said. "I used to go and walk up and down that
little path across the head of the lake, and plan out how
I would do it. Even now I do not think that any one,
except perhaps your mother, would ever have suspected.
It would have been so easy to make it appear
an absolute accident."</p>

<p class="indent">He remained silent, and she went on, more composedly:</p>

<p class="indent">"I had got into a selfish, morbid state, Oliver, and
yet the temptation was not wholly selfish, for I knew
that Godfrey was miserable too, and my sense told
me that if anything happened to me he would very
soon marry again&mdash;some woman who would appreciate
his good qualities, who would be happy with him,
who would not be, as I knew I was, a bitter disappointment."</p>

<p class="indent">Once more her voice had become nearly inaudible,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
and once more Oliver bent his dark, convulsed face
down to hear what she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Tears were rolling down Laura's face. But suddenly
she made an immense effort over herself, and
went on, calmly:</p>

<p class="indent">"It was your mother who helped me over that bad,
foolish time. I don't know what I should have done
but for Aunt Letty. I think she's the only person in
the world to whom Godfrey ever listens&mdash;who can
ever make any impression on him. It's strange in a
way, for I know she doesn't really like either of us."</p>

<p class="indent">As he uttered a violent expression of dissent, she
went on: "It's quite true, Oliver, and what is more,
of the two she likes Godfrey the best. Why shouldn't
she? She thinks I've behaved very unkindly to Godfrey.
The only excuse she can make for me&mdash;she told
me so once, long ago&mdash;is that I'm inhuman. I suppose
in a way I <i>am</i> inhuman?" She looked at him
plaintively, a strange, piteous expression in her beautiful,
shadowed eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">And Oliver Tropenell caught his breath. God&mdash;how
he loved her! Her inhumanity&mdash;to use that cruelly
misleading term which she had just used herself&mdash;only
made his passion burn with a purer, whiter flame.
The one thing in the world that mattered to him now
was this woman's deliverance from the awful death-in-life
to which her sensitive conscience, and her moving
love for her child, alone condemned her. Yes,
Laura's deliverance was the only thing worth compassing&mdash;and
that even if the deliverer were wrecked,
soul as well as body, body as well as soul, in the
process.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
They began walking again, slowly, slowly, once
more enwrapped in a silence which said so much more
than words could have said, even to Laura's still
numb, unawakened heart.</p>

<p class="indent">It was she who at last broke the kind of spell which
lay on them both. They had come almost to the end
of the broad path. Opposite to where they were standing,
on the other side of the road, was a huge white
and green building, handsome and showy, looking
strangely un-English and out of place in the famous
old London way.</p>

<p class="indent">"They pulled down such a wonderful, delightful
house just there," she said regretfully. "I was once
taken to it by my father, when I was quite a little
girl. It was like going right back a hundred years&mdash;not
only to another London, but to another England.
It's a shame that any one should have been allowed
to pull down such a bit of old London as that."</p>

<p class="indent">And Oliver agreed, absently.</p>

<p class="indent">So, talking of indifferent things, they walked back
to the hotel where Mrs. Tropenell was awaiting them,
and the three afterwards spent the rest of the day
peacefully together. But the next day there began
again for them all the same dreary round&mdash;that odd,
artificial life of "having a good time," as Gillie jovially
put it.</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow Laura did not mind it so much now as
she had done before. Her talk with Oliver had shifted
her burden a little, and made her feel as if he and
she had gone back to their old, happy, simple friendship.
It had also deadened her feeling of acute, unreasoning
anger with Godfrey.</p>

<p class="indent">At last came the morning when Oliver and Gillie
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
were to go to Paris. And at the last moment, standing
on the platform at Charing Cross, there took place
a rather pathetic, ridiculous little scene.</p>

<p class="indent">Gillie had bought for his sister a beautiful old jewel,
and he thrust it&mdash;with a merry little word as to this
being the first really nice present he had ever given
her&mdash;into her hand. When she opened the case and
saw the emerald and pearl heart, her eyes brimmed
over with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Even Gillie was moved. "There, there!" he exclaimed.
"Nothing to cry about&mdash;'Nuff said,' Laura.
Perhaps we'll meet again sooner than you think,
my friends the Americans say."</p>

<p class="indent">And she tried to smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Gillie turned to Mrs. Tropenell, speaking with
much greater sincerity of feeling than he was wont
to do. "I'll never forget your kindness&mdash;in the past
and in the present&mdash;to my sister and to me, Mrs.
Tropenell. I'm not such a careless brute as I seem
to be&mdash;I never forget a kindness&mdash;or an injury. Now
then, Oliver!"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura felt her hand seized, closed on in a vice-like
pressure which hurt, then dropped. "Good-bye,
Laura," said Oliver in an almost inaudible tone.
"Good-bye, till we meet again."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="cap">AS so often happens after hours or days of crises,
and even of quarrel, things went better for a
while after Laura's return to The Chase.</p>

<p class="indent">True, life was now, even more than before, dull,
sad, and difficult. She missed Oliver Tropenell's constant
companionship and stimulating talk, more than
she was willing to acknowledge even to her innermost
self. And yet, when Godfrey spoke of the other
man's absence from Freshley with regret, his words
jarred on her, and made her feel vaguely ashamed.
Yet surely, surely she had nothing to reproach herself
with in the matter of Oliver Tropenell? She would
so gladly have kept him as Godfrey's friend as well
as her own.</p>

<p class="indent">They had made it up, those two ill-matched people&mdash;made
it up, that is, after a fashion. They were
now much where they had been six months ago, just
before Oliver Tropenell with his strong, masterful
personality had come into their joint lives.</p>

<p class="indent">And Godfrey? Godfrey Pavely was happier, more
complacent than usual, during those late autumn days.
He also was ashamed&mdash;though not unreasonably so&mdash;of
the absurd importance he had attached to those two
vulgar anonymous letters! He was sorry now that
he had spoken of the matter to Oliver Tropenell, for
that odd, rather awkward talk of theirs on the matter
had been perhaps a contributory cause of the other
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
man's sudden departure. If Oliver came home for
Christmas, he, Godfrey, would "make it all right."</p>

<p class="indent">The banker had yet another reason for feeling life
pleasanter than usual just now. He was engaged in
a rather big bit of financial business of a kind his soul
loved, for it was secret, immediately profitable, and
with a gambling risk attached to it. The only person
to whom he had said a word concerning the affair was
Katty Winslow, and even to her, for he was a very
prudent man, he had been quite vague.</p>

<p class="indent">With Katty he was becoming daily more intimate.
Laura's cold aloofness made him seek, instinctively, a
kinder, warmer, and yes, occasionally, a tenderer feminine
presence. For the first time, lately, Godfrey had
begun to tell himself that Katty would have made an
almost perfect wife.... And Katty could have told
you almost the exact moment when that thought had
first flashed upon Godfrey Pavely's brain. But she
also knew that so far he was content, most irritatingly
content, with the <i>status quo</i>. Not so she&mdash;&mdash;And
one evening Katty tried an experiment which was
on the whole remarkably successful, though its effects
were strangely different from what she had expected.</p>

<p class="indent">While dining alone with Godfrey and Laura at
The Chase, she startled her host and hostess by throwing
out a careless word as to the possibility of her
leaving Rosedean&mdash;of letting the house furnished, for
a year....</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was astonished to see how much this casual
remark of Katty's upset Godfrey. He uttered an
exclamation of deep surprise and annoyance, and his
wife told herself bitterly how strange it was that Godfrey,
feeling so strongly about Katty, should not understand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
how she, Laura, felt about Gillie. After all,
Gillie was her own brother, and Katty was not Godfrey's
sister&mdash;only an old playmate and friend!</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey was, in very truth, much more than upset
at those few careless words of his old friend&mdash;playmate,
in the sense that Laura meant, she had never
been. So disturbed and taken aback indeed that he
lay awake much of that night.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning he broke his walk into Pewsbury
by going into Rosedean, this being the very first time
he had ever done such a thing.</p>

<p class="indent">He was kept waiting a few moments&mdash;as a matter
of fact only a very few moments&mdash;in the familiar little
drawing-room, before Katty, wearing a charming,
pale blue dressing-gown, edged with swansdown,
joined him.</p>

<p class="indent">As was her way, she began speaking at once. "Why,
what's the matter?" she exclaimed. "Has anything
gone wrong, Godfrey?"</p>

<p class="indent">He answered irritably, "No, not that I know of.
But I've something to say to you." He pulled out his
big, old-fashioned gold repeater. "It's twenty to ten&mdash;I
thought I'd find you down!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I always breakfast upstairs in my own room. But
I didn't keep you waiting long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She was still a little breathless, for she had come
down very quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he began, with no preamble: "I want
to know if you really meant what you said last night
about letting this house furnished for a year? I'm
by no means sure if the terms of your lease allow for
your doing that; I shall have to look into it after I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
get to the Bank. Still, I thought I'd better come and
see you first."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty grew very pink. "Oh, Godfrey!" she exclaimed.
"Surely you wouldn't be so unkind&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">There came over her pretty face that curious, obstinate
look which he had already seen there often enough
to dread. Also she made him feel ashamed of himself.
But how attractive she looked&mdash;how fresh and dainty&mdash;like
a newly opened rose! Katty had twisted up
her hair anyhow, but that only made her look younger,
and more natural.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let's come out into the garden," she said coaxingly.
"Surely you can stay for a few minutes? This is the
very first time you've ever been to see me in the morning!
Why not telephone through and say you've been
delayed,&mdash;that you can't be at the Bank till eleven?"
She was edging him as she spoke towards the corner
where, behind a screen, there stood the telephone instrument.</p>

<p class="indent">As if compelled to obey, he took up the receiver,
and uttered the familiar words, "Pewsbury 4." And
at once there came an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that you, Privet? What a comfort it is to know
that I can always rely on your being there, whoever
else isn't! This is only to say that I have been delayed,
and that I don't expect to be at the Bank till
eleven."</p>

<p class="indent">Then came the calming, comforting answer, "Very
good. That'll be all right, sir. There's nothing much
doing this morning, from what I could make out when
I was looking over your letters just now."</p>

<p class="indent">So Godfrey Pavely, feeling rather as if he was being
driven along by a pleasant fate, hung the receiver
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
up, and followed the blue-garbed figure out of doors,
into a little pleasance now filled with exquisite autumnal
colouring, and pungent, searching scents.</p>

<p class="indent">In the furthest corner of the walled garden, which
was so much older than the house itself, was a tiny
lawn surrounded by high hedges. There they could
talk without any fear of being overlooked or overheard;
and, before her visitor could stop her, Katty
had dragged two cane-seated easy chairs out of her
little summer-house.</p>

<p class="indent">They both sat down, but this time Katty warily remained
silent. She was waiting for her companion to
begin.</p>

<p class="indent">"You weren't serious, were you?" he said at last,
and she felt the underlying pain and surprise in his
voice. "You don't really mean that you want to go
away, Katty? Where would you go to? What would
you do? Have the Standens asked you to go abroad
again&mdash;not for a whole year, surely?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," she said slowly, "not the Standens. If you
must know, I've been offered a furnished cottage rent-free
by those friends of mine, the Haworths, who live
near York. The truth is, I can't afford to keep up
Rosedean! I hate saying this to you, but it's the
truth."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you didn't go away so much&mdash;&mdash;" he began irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">But she cut across him sharply, "After all, I've a
right to go away if I like! But it isn't that, Godfrey.
I've gone into it all&mdash;really I have! Even if I never
left Rosedean I should still be too poor to go on living
here comfortably."</p>

<p class="indent">"How much too poor?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
Katty drew a long breath. In a sense she was
speaking at random, but no one would have known
it from the tone in which she answered: "About a
hundred a year&mdash;a little less, a little more."</p>

<p class="indent">And then Godfrey Pavely said something which
very much surprised Katty. "About that thousand
pounds which was left to you the other day," he said
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well? That'll only bring in thirty-five pounds a
year; you made all the arrangements," she added
wearily. "You wouldn't let me have it&mdash;as I wanted
you to do."</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn't, Katty, you know that! I didn't ask
your aunt to make me your trustee."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, that thirty-five pounds won't make any difference."</p>

<p class="indent">She was sorry now she had told him of the little
house on her generous friends' estate. Perhaps he
would offer to let her off the Rosedean rent. But
Katty had quite made up her mind to cut the cable,
and make a fresh start elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait a bit," he said slowly, "women always run
on so fast! When I mentioned that thousand pounds,
I was not thinking of giving it you, as you call it, to
spend. I was thinking of that foreign investment I
mentioned to you last week. If you're willing to take
the risk, I might stretch a point, for if things go well
that thousand pounds might easily be trebled in the
course of the next two years. I'm so sure of that, that
I'm quite willing to advance you, say, two hundred
pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">He knew quite well that his proposal was utterly
illogical, and bore, so to speak, no relation to the fact
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>
that the investment he was proposing might turn up
trumps.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty's eyes sparkled. She was very fond of ready
money, and it was such a long, long time since she had
had any. "D'you mean you'd really give me two hundred
pounds <i>now</i>?" she asked joyfully.</p>

<p class="indent">And Godfrey, with his eyes fixed on the grass, said
in a shamed voice, "Yes&mdash;that is what I do mean."</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow it hurt him to feel how that sum of
money, so trifling to him, affected her so keenly. He
was better pleased with her next question.</p>

<p class="indent">"What sort of an investment exactly is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's in the nature of a company promotion," he
said slowly. "And of course you must regard anything
I tell you about it as absolutely private."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I quite understand that!"</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a piece of paper out of his pocket. "As a
matter of fact I've got a few facts about it jotted down
here."</p>

<p class="indent">She drew her chair rather nearer to his, and Godfrey
Pavely, turning his narrow yet fleshy face towards
her, began speaking with far more eagerness and animation
than usual. Katty, who was by no means a
fool where such things were concerned, listened absorbedly
while he explained the rather big bit of financial
business in which he was now interested.</p>

<p class="indent">After he had been speaking to her without interruption
for some minutes, Katty exclaimed: "Yes, I
think I see now exactly what you mean! There certainly
doesn't seem much risk attached to it&mdash;at any
rate as regards the start off, as it were. But what
made these French bankers pick <i>you</i> out, Godfrey?
After all, they're doing you a very good turn."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
"I don't exactly know why they picked me out, as
you call it&mdash;&mdash;" he spoke hesitatingly. "But during
that year I spent in Paris I came across a great many
of that sort of people. My father got me the best
possible introductions."</p>

<p class="indent">The piece of paper on which he had jotted certain
notes and calculations was a large piece of thin foreign
notepaper covered with small handwriting in the diluted
ink which some French business men use.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can you read French?" he asked doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">She answered rather sharply, "Yes, of course I
can!" and held out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter, which bore a Paris address, and the date
of a fortnight back, was from the French banking
house of Zosean &amp; Co. It explained at some length
that a client of the bank, a wealthy South American
of Portuguese extraction named Fernando Apra, had
become possessed of an estate on the coast of Portugal
to which was attached a gambling concession. The
idea was to make the place a kind of Portuguese Monte
Carlo, and the present possessor was very desirous
that English capital and English brains should be put
into the company. The returns promised were enormous,
and there seemed to be little or no risk attached
to the business&mdash;if it was run on the right lines.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have gone into the matter very thoroughly," said
Godfrey Pavely, "and I have convinced myself that
it's all right. This Fernando Apra already has a London
office. I managed to see him there for a few
minutes last week. His real headquarters are in
Paris."</p>

<p class="indent">"And are you finding all the money?" asked Katty
eagerly. "Will it be all your money and <i>my</i> thousand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;168]</span>
pounds, Godfrey? In that case I suppose we shall
get all the profits?"</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled a little at woman's cupidity. "No," he
said, "I haven't been able to find it all myself. But
I've managed to get in a very good man. Some one
with whom I've done business before, Katty."</p>

<p class="indent">"What's his name?" she asked inquisitively.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely waited a moment. "I don't know
that I ought to tell you&mdash;" he said uncomfortably.
"He doesn't want to appear in the business."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you ought to tell me!" All sorts of
strange ideas floated through Katty's mind. Was he
going to say "Oliver Tropenell"? She rather expected
he was.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I <i>will</i> tell you," he said, "for I know you can
hold your tongue. The name of the man who's going
into this business with me is Greville Howard."</p>

<p class="indent">"D'you mean the big money-lender?" Katty
couldn't help a little tone of doubt, of rather shocked
surprise, creeping into her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said doggedly, "I do mean the man who
was once a great money-lender. He's retired now&mdash;in
fact he's living&mdash;&mdash;" and then he stopped himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, of course!" Katty felt quite excited. "He's
living in Yorkshire, near the Haworths! They've
often talked about him to me! They don't know him&mdash;he
won't know anybody. He's a rather queer fish,
isn't he, Godfrey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He's absolutely straight about money," exclaimed
Godfrey Pavely defensively. "I've had dealings with
him over many years. In fact he's the ideal man for
this kind of thing. He has all sorts of irons in the fire&mdash;financially
I mean&mdash;on the Continent. He's a big
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
shareholder in the company that runs the Dieppe and
Boulogne Casinos."</p>

<p class="indent">He got up. "Well, I ought to be going now. It's
all right isn't it, Katty? You won't talk again of going
away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you let me have that two hundred pounds
this afternoon?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey Pavely looked at her with a curious, yearning,
rather sad look. Somehow he would have preferred
that Katty should not be quite so&mdash;so&mdash;he
hardly formulated the thought to himself&mdash;so ready
to do <i>anything</i> for money. "Very well," he said.
"Very well, my dear"&mdash;he very seldom called her "my
dear," but he had done so once or twice lately. "I'll
bring it this afternoon, in notes."</p>

<p class="indent">"That <i>will</i> be kind of you," she said gratefully.
"But look here, Godfrey, do take it out of my thousand
pounds! Put eight hundred in this thing."</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head and smiled. Women were queer,
curiously unscrupulous creatures! "That would be
right down dishonest of me, Katty."</p>

<p class="indent">They were now walking across the little lawn,
which was so securely tucked away, out of sight of
any prying window, and before going through the
aperture which had been cut in the hedge, they both
turned round and clasped hands. "Thank you so&mdash;so
much," she said softly. "You've been a dear, kind
friend to me always, Godfrey."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have I?" he said. "Have I, Katty? Not always,
I fear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, always," and her voice trembled a little.</p>

<p class="indent">He bent down and kissed her on the mouth with a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
kind of shamed, passionate solemnity which moved,
and, yes, a little amused her. What <i>queer</i>, curiously
scrupulous creatures men were!</p>

<p class="indent">"Go now, or you'll be late," she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">And he went.</p>

<h2>PART TWO</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="cap">CERTAIN days become retrospectively memorable,
and that however apparently uneventful they may
have seemed at the time.</p>

<p class="indent">To Laura Pavely the 6th of January opened as had
done all the other days during the last few weeks, that
is, quietly, dully, and sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was one difference, trifling or not as one
happened to look at the matter. Godfrey was away in
London. He had been absent for over a week&mdash;since
the 28th, and though he had been expected back last
night, there had come a telephone message, late in the
afternoon, to say that his business would keep him
away a day longer.</p>

<p class="indent">This morning&mdash;it was a Friday morning&mdash;Laura,
trying hard to shake off her depression, told herself
that she and Alice might as well go for a ride. It was
a beautiful day, and the wind blew soft. They would
go across the downs to a certain lonely spot which
Alice loved.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was already in the hall in her riding habit,
waiting for the child, when there came a telephone
message through from Pewsbury. It was from the
Bank asking what time Mr. Pavely would be there.
A gentleman with whom he had made an appointment
for ten o'clock, had been waiting for him since that
hour. It was now nearly eleven.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
Laura turned to the servant: "Did Mr. Pavely give
you any message to send on to the Bank?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The man answered, "No, ma'am, not that I understood.
Mr. Pavely didn't come himself to the telephone."</p>

<p class="indent">"What was the message exactly?" Laura was always
kind and courteous in her manner to her servants, and
they were all attached to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was as how Mr. Pavely was being detained, and
could not be home last night, ma'am. The person who
gave the message was in a great hurry&mdash;he cut me off
before I could say anything to him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose we ought to have telephoned to the Bank
early this morning," said Laura thoughtfully. But it
had never occurred to her that it would be necessary
for her to do so. Her husband was a very exact man
of business. She had taken it as certain that he had
also communicated with the Bank.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who was it telephoned just now?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it was Mr. Privet himself, ma'am. He
said he felt sure Mr. Pavely intended to be back this
morning, because of the gentleman he had arranged
to see."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps I had better speak to Mr. Privet myself,"
said Laura. "Is that you, Mr. Privet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish you a very good morning, Mrs. Pavely.
I didn't mean to put you to any trouble, but you see
the matter is important&mdash;&mdash;" Even through the telephone
she could hear a mysterious tone in the old
voice, though he was speaking in so low a tone that
she could scarcely hear. "It's Lord St. Amant. He's
been here since ten o'clock, and he says he can't stop
any longer. Mr. Pavely made an appointment with his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
lordship over a week ago. It's very strange he should
have forgotten, isn't it, Mrs. Pavely?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I think it <i>is</i> strange," she said slowly. "Will
you tell his lordship that I'm exceedingly sorry that
word was not sent him. If I had known of the appointment,
of course I would have communicated with him
either by telephone or by a note."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I'm to put off all Mr. Pavely's appointments
for to-day?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, yes, Mr. Privet, that seems to me the only
thing you can do."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura smiled a little as she left the telephone. Mr.
Privet's tone, if not his words, made it quite clear
that he thought Mr. Pavely had committed a serious
solecism, almost the worst solecism a country banker
could commit, in not keeping an appointment with the
great man of the neighbourhood, who was to be the
new Lord Lieutenant of the county.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">An hour and a half later, as mother and child were
riding slowly home, Laura suddenly told herself that
it was a long time since Mrs. Tropenell had seen Alice
on pony-back. Why shouldn't they both go on to
Freshley? And if Aunt Letty asked them to stay to
lunch, as she very probably would, so much the better!</p>

<p class="indent">On their way to the front door of the house, they
turned into the stable-yard to find a groom, and then,
suddenly, Laura felt a queer, and to herself an utterly
unexpected and new, sensation sweep over her. It was
a sensation of eager, unreasoning joy.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell stood in the middle of the yard,
talking to his mother's old groom. He looked ill and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
tired&mdash;dreadfully tired. But all at once, as he saw
Laura and her child come riding in, a wonderful
change swept over his dark face&mdash;there came over it
a glowing expression of welcome and delight. He
lifted Alice off her pony. Then he came forward to
help Laura....</p>

<p class="indent">With a shock of surprise which seemed to make
her heart stop beating, Laura felt her whole being
responding to the ardent, and at once imperious and
imploring look with which he gazed up into her eyes.
She was shaken, awed by the passion he threw, perhaps
unconsciously, into that long, beckoning look&mdash;stirred
to the heart by the feeling of content his mere
presence brought her.</p>

<p class="indent">But even in those few flashing moments, Laura
Pavely quickly, almost fiercely, assured herself that
this new, strange sensation of oneness, of surrender
on her part, was "friendship," nothing more.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet her voice faltered in spite of herself, as she
said, "Hadn't we better ride round? I only came in
here to find some one to hold the horses, in case your
mother wanted us to come in."</p>

<p class="indent">But with a muttered, "Mother has got Lord St.
Amant to luncheon&mdash;I know she would like you both
to stay, too," he lifted her off her horse.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked to a door which led into the back
part of the house, and so by a corridor to a small room
where Mrs. Tropenell generally sat in the morning. As
they went along, Alice, alone, chattered happily.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Laura, more for the sake of proving to herself
that she felt quite at ease than for anything else,
asked suddenly, "I suppose you didn't see Godfrey on
your way through London?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
Oliver waited a few moments&mdash;so long indeed that
she wondered if he had heard her. But she knew in
her heart that he had, for his face had darkened at
the mention of her husband's name. At last he answered,
very deliberately, "Is Godfrey away then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. He went off some days ago. We expected
him home yesterday; but he sent a telephone message
to say he wasn't coming back till to-night."</p>

<p class="indent">They were now before the door of Mrs. Tropenell's
sitting-room. Her son opened it quietly, and for a
moment the three stood there, gazing into the panelled,
sunlit little room, which was part of the survival of a
much older building than the eighteenth-century manor-house.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell, sitting upright in a low chair, was
looking up into the face of the man who stood before
her, and they were both so absorbed in what they were
saying that neither had heard the door open.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura gazed with new eyes, a new curiosity, at
Lord St. Amant. She had seen him often in this
house, though sometimes at comparatively long intervals,
ever since she was a child, and always he had had
a fixed place, in her mind and imagination, as Mrs.
Tropenell's one man-friend.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day, seeing the two thus talking eagerly together
she felt her interest oddly quickened. She was asking
herself eagerly whether some such passage as that
which had taken place between herself and Oliver
Tropenell three months ago, and which had caused her
so much pain, had ever occurred between those two in
the days when Lady St. Amant, a fretful, selfish invalid
whom every one disliked, was still alive. If yes, then
Mrs. Tropenell had evidently known how to retain the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
friendship, the warm affections of a man who, younger,
had been notoriously inconstant.</p>

<p class="indent">In Laura's eyes these two had always been old when
she thought of them at all. But to-day she realised, as
in a flash, that the man and woman before her had also
been young, and that not so very long ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Even now, Lord St. Amant was a still vigorous and
active-looking man. He was leaning over the back
of a chair, looking eagerly into his old friend's face.
Was it true, as some of the gossips said, that he had
remained a widower for that same friend's sake?</p>

<p class="indent">Laura gazed at him with an almost hungry curiosity.
She was absurdly surprised that he looked to-day exactly
as he had always looked in her eyes&mdash;a pleasant,
agreeable-mannered, amusing man of the world, not at
all her notion of the one-time lover of many women.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant's hair had now gone white, but,
apart from that he looked just as he had been wont
to look, when he came and went about Freshley Manor,
when she, as a child, had stayed there with her mother.
Some years later, she had become dimly aware&mdash;girls
always know such things&mdash;that Mrs. Tropenell had
had a fleeting notion of marrying her to Lord St.
Amant. But Laura had also known that it was Mrs.
Tropenell, not herself, who was the magnet which then
drew him so often to Freshley Manor.</p>

<p class="indent">They had once, however, had an intimate talk together.
It had been on one of the very rare occasions
when Mrs. Tropenell was ill, confined to bed, upstairs,
and she, Laura Baynton, had been left alone to entertain
her Aunt Letty's old friend. And their talk&mdash;she
remembered it now&mdash;had been all of Oliver: of Oliver
and his mother.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Lord St. Amant had spoken with much heat of
Oliver's having settled on the other side of the world,
leaving Mrs. Tropenell lonely. Then he had smiled a
curious little smile: "But that makes no difference.
To a mother 'distance makes the heart grow fonder,'
and also 'lends enchantment to the view.' An only
son, Laura, is the most formidable of rivals."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had been flattered, touched too, by the implied
confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">She had yet another vivid memory of Lord St.
Amant. He had sent her, immediately on hearing of
her engagement to Godfrey Pavely, a magnificent
wedding present; also he had come, at some inconvenience,
to her marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey had supposed the compliment due to regard
for himself and for his father, but Laura, of course,
had known better. Lord St. Amant had come to her
marriage to please Mrs. Tropenell&mdash;because he regarded
her, in a sense, as Mrs. Tropenell's adopted
daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Something of all this moved in quick procession
through Laura Pavely's mind, as she stood in the doorway,
looking more beautiful, more animated, more
feminine, in spite of&mdash;or was it because of?&mdash;her
riding dress, than Oliver Tropenell had ever seen her.</p>

<p class="indent">She moved forward into the room, and Lord St.
Amant turned quickly round.</p>

<p class="indent">If Laura looked at Lord St. Amant with a new interest,
a new curiosity in her beautiful eyes, he, on his
side, now looked at Laura more attentively than he
had done for a long time. He had been abroad for
two months, and this was the first time he and Mrs.
Tropenell had met since his return.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
They had just had a long talk, and during that
talk she had at last told him something which had
amused, surprised, and yes, interested him very much;
for Lord St. Amant, in the evening of his days, found
himself more, not less, tolerant of, and interested in,
human nature, and in human nature's curious kinks
and byways, than at the time when he himself had provided
his friends and contemporaries with food for
gossip and scandal. But he had been very comforting
in his comments on her story, and more than once he
had made his old friend smile. Mrs. Tropenell had
felt very, very glad to see Lord St. Amant. It was
natural that she should be glad to have once more
within easy reach of her the one human being in the
world to whom she could talk freely, and who took an
unaffectedly close, deep interest in all her concerns.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Not till they were all sitting at luncheon, was Laura
able, in a low tone, to inquire after her brother. Little
Alice knew nothing of her uncle's visit to England.
Godfrey and Laura had tacitly agreed to keep the child
in ignorance of it. But now Laura asked, with some
eagerness, "And Gillie? What's happened to Gillie?
Is he still abroad?"</p>

<p class="indent">Olive answered at once, "No, he's gone back to
Mexico." And then, as he saw a look of blank disappointment
shadow her face, he added, hastily, "He
gave me a lot of messages for you&mdash;I was coming over
this afternoon to deliver them. You know what Gillie's
like&mdash;he never writes if he can help it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said, "I know that," and she sighed.
"Did he go from a French port?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver hesitated. It was almost as if he had forgotten.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span>
But at last he answered, "Yes, he went from
Havre. I saw him off."</p>

<p class="indent">And then something rather untoward happened.
There came a violent ringing at the front door&mdash;a loud,
imperious pulling at the big, old-fashioned iron bell-pull.
To the surprise of his mother, Oliver flushed&mdash;a
deep, unbecoming brick red. Starting up from table,
he pushed his chair aside, and walked quickly to the
door. It was almost as if he expected some one. "I'll
see who it is!" he called out.</p>

<p class="indent">They heard him striding across the hall, and flinging
open the front door....</p>

<p class="indent">Then he came back slowly, and Mrs. Tropenell saw
that there was a look of immeasurable relief on his
face. "It's a man who's brought a parcel from Pewsbury
for one of the servants. He declared he couldn't
make any one hear at the back, and so he came round
to the front door&mdash;rather impudent of him, eh?" and
he sat down again.</p>

<p class="indent">Coffee was served in the pleasant, low-ceilinged
drawing-room, and then Oliver and Laura went out
of doors, with Alice trotting by their side.</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite like old times. And the child voiced
their unspoken feeling, when, slipping her hand into
Oliver's, she exclaimed, "This is jolly! Just like what
it used to be when you were here before!"</p>

<p class="indent">And he pressed the little hand which lay so confidingly
in his. "Yes," he said, in a low voice, "the same&mdash;but
nicer, don't you think so, Alice?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Alice answered with the downrightness of
childhood, "I can't tell yet! I shall know that after
you've been here a little while. We can't garden as
much as we did then, for now the ground is too hard."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
"But we can do other things," said Oliver, smiling
down at her.</p>

<p class="indent">And Alice answered doubtfully, "Yes, I suppose
we can."</p>

<p class="indent">They did not say very much. Oliver did not talk, as
perhaps another man would have done, of his and
Gillie's adventures in France and Italy. And after a
comparatively short time Laura suggested that she
and Alice had better now ride home.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you come over to tea?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">And Oliver said yes, that he would.</p>

<p class="indent">"I daresay Godfrey will be back by then. He often
takes the early afternoon train down from London."</p>

<p class="indent">But to that he made no answer, and Laura, with a
rather painful sensation, saw the light suddenly die
out of his face.</p>

<p class="indent">He came round to the stable. "I'll walk a little way
with you," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">But she exclaimed rather hurriedly, "No, don't do
that, Oliver! Stay with your mother and Lord St.
Amant."</p>

<p class="indent">And without any word of protest he obeyed her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It is strange what a difference the return of a friend
may make to life! Laura Pavely felt another woman
as she busied herself that afternoon, happily waiting
for Oliver Tropenell. Honestly she hoped that Godfrey
would come back by the early afternoon train; he,
too, would be glad to see Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">But the time went by, and there came no message
through from London ordering the car to be sent to
the station, and Laura told herself that perhaps Godfrey
had gone straight to the Bank.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;183]</span>
At last, a little after five, Oliver Tropenell came
sauntering in, very much as he used to saunter in,
during the long happy summer days when they had
just become friends.</p>

<p class="indent">They had tea in Alice's day-nursery, and after tea,
they all three played games till it was nearly seven.
Then, reluctantly, Oliver got up, and said he must go
home. And as he stood there, gazing down into her
face, Laura was struck, as she had been that morning
in the first moment of their meeting, by his look of
fatigue and of strain. She, who was so little apt to
notice such things, unless her little girl was in question,
glanced up at him anxiously. "You don't look well,"
she said, with some concern. "You don't look as if
you'd had a holiday, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall soon get all right," he muttered, "now that
I'm here, with mother." And then, in a lower voice,
he added the words, "and with you, Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">She answered, nervously determined to hark back to
what had been their old, happy condition, "Alice and
I have both missed you dreadfully&mdash;haven't we, my
darling?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Alice said gaily, "Oh yes, indeed, we have,
mother." Then the child turned, in her pretty, eager
way to Oliver, "I hope you'll stay a long, long time
at Freshley. If only it snows, father thinks it may
soon, you and I can make a snow man!"</p>

<p class="indent">And Oliver, after a moment's pause, answered,
"Yes, so we can, Alice. I'm going to stay at home
some time now, I hope."</p>

<p class="indent">And again, on hearing those words, Laura felt that
new, unreasoning thrill of joy which she had felt
when she had seen Oliver standing in the middle of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;184]</span>
his mother's stable-yard. Till that moment, and now
again, just now, she had not known how much she
had missed her friend.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, when it was really time for him to go,
Laura and Alice both accompanied their guest to the
hall. Then he turned abruptly to Laura: "How about
to-morrow? May I come to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">And over Laura there came just a little tremour of
misgiving. Surely Oliver was going to be&mdash;reasonable?</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said hesitatingly, "I shall be very glad
to see you&mdash;though of course I'm rather busy in the
morning. To-morrow Mademoiselle is not coming.
Perhaps I'd better telephone early and tell you our
plans for the day. Godfrey will be so glad to see
you, Oliver. He asked only the other day when Mrs.
Tropenell expected you back."</p>

<p class="indent">But to that remark Oliver made no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">After the heavy front door had shut behind her
visitor, and when Alice had already run out of the
hall, Laura opened the front door again.</p>

<p class="indent">She called out: "Perhaps you'll meet Godfrey. He
may be here any moment now; if he's been at the
Bank, he will walk out from Pewsbury."</p>

<p class="indent">But Oliver did not turn round. He was evidently
already out of hearing.</p>

<p class="indent">Feeling strangely restless, Laura walked out a little
way, closing the door partly behind her. There
was about a quarter of a mile of carriage road from
the house to the gate, but the night was very clear,
the ground hard and dry. Soon her eyes became accustomed
to the darkness; she could see Oliver's tall
figure rapidly growing less and less, dimmer and dimmer.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
Every moment she expected to see another, still
more familiar, form emerge from out of the darkness.
But, after pacing up and down for perhaps as
long as ten minutes, she went back into the house.
Godfrey was evidently coming home by the last train.</p>

<p class="indent">Moved by an indefinable feeling of peace as well
as of contentment, Laura sat up long that night, waiting
for her husband. She had made up her mind to
tell him, not only that Oliver had come back, but also
that her brother was on his way to Mexico. Half
ashamedly she asked herself why they should not all
three go back to the happy conditions which had lasted
all the summer?</p>

<p class="indent">But there came neither Godfrey nor news of him,
and Laura spent the evening of a day of which the
date was to become memorable, not unhappily in reading.</p>

<p class="indent">When it came to half-past eleven, she knew that
her husband would not be home that night, but, even
so, she sat up till the tall lacquered clock in the hall
struck out the chimes of midnight. Then, a little
reluctantly, she went upstairs, telling herself that if
in the morning there was still no news of Godfrey,
she and Alice would stroll along to Rosedean. Katty
might know something of Godfrey's movements, for
when she had been last at The Chase an illusion had
been made to a bit of business he was to do for her
in London, which would necessitate some correspondence.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;186]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="cap">THERE are certain winter days when bed and
bath seem to be the only two tolerable places in
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty Winslow, on waking up the next morning,
that is, on Saturday, the seventh of January, knew
at once, though she was snuggled down deep in her
warm bed, that it was very much colder than it had
been the evening before. She shivered a little, telling
herself that perhaps she was not in as good condition
as usual, for she had only just come back from spending
Christmas and the New Year away.</p>

<p class="indent">The faithful Harber drew back the curtains, letting
in gleams of red winter sun. And then she brought
her mistress a nice cup of hot tea, and a pretty, wadded,
pale-blue bed wrap.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty sat up. "I'm not in any hurry to-day," she
said. "I'll ring when I want breakfast." And after
having taken her tea she lay down again, and began
to think.</p>

<p class="indent">Oddly, or perhaps naturally, enough, her thoughts
turned to Godfrey Pavely. She wondered vaguely
where he was, and if he would be home to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been a kind of half arrangement between
them that they would travel down from London
together on the Thursday afternoon. That would
have meant for Katty the benefit of The Chase motor&mdash;a
pleasant as well as an economical plan&mdash;and its
owner's company as far as Rosedean.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
But Katty had not found Godfrey Pavely at the
London station, though she had lingered about up to
the very last moment before taking, regretfully, a
third-class ticket. On arriving at Pewsbury she had
also waited some minutes in the vague hope that Godfrey
might have dashed up just as the train was leaving&mdash;not
that he was apt to dash at any time, for he
was always very careful of himself, and had a due regard
for his personal dignity. But there was no sign
of the familiar figure, and so Katty had had to take
a fly&mdash;a slow, smelly, expensive fly&mdash;out to Rosedean.</p>

<p class="indent">Yesterday, Friday, had been a rather tiresome, dull
day, spent in hearing from Harber all the disagreeable
things which had happened while she had been
away&mdash;how Harber's stupid, untrained girl-help had
gone and broken a rather nice piece of china in the
drawing-room, and also how it had come to pass that
there were two slates off the roof.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty had rather expected Godfrey would come
in, if only to apologise for having failed her during
the journey. But the afternoon had gone slowly by,
and at last she felt sure, knowing his ways, that he
had not yet come home. Something must have delayed
him&mdash;something, perhaps, connected with that pleasant
Portuguese gambling concession which was to
bring them both such a lot of money. But if that
were so, she would almost certainly receive from
him this morning one of his rather long, explanatory
letters. Of late Godfrey had fallen into the way of
writing to Katty almost every day when they were
apart.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Mrs. Winslow meant to keep the fact
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
strictly to herself&mdash;for it was one that might have
somewhat surprised even the unsuspicious Laura&mdash;she
and Godfrey had actually spent a long day together
during their dual absence from home.</p>

<p class="indent">It had fallen out as such pleasant meetings sometimes
do fall out, very naturally and innocently, just
a week ago to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty, on her way from the south to stay with her
friends, the Haworths, had run up against Godfrey
Pavely at King's Cross. That had been a really
extraordinary coincidence, and one of which it would
have been foolish not to take advantage. For it
turned out that he also was going to Yorkshire, and
on the business in which they were both interested,
to spend a night with the ex-money-lender, Greville
Howard. That gentleman, it seemed, was making
certain difficulties about the matter&mdash;he wanted to
stay his hand till he had seen the French bankers who
were concerned with the affair. As he spent each
spring in the south of France, that would not be
such a difficulty as it seemed. Still, it was a bore,
and the other had felt he had better go and see him.</p>

<p class="indent">After a pleasant journey together, as they were
steaming into York station Godfrey suddenly asked:
"Must you go on to your friends at once? Couldn't
you telephone to them to meet you by a later train?
I'm in no hurry." And, smilingly, she had consented.</p>

<p class="indent">Of late Katty's heart had become very soft to her
old friend. For one thing he was being so good to
her in the matter of money. That two hundred
pounds he had given to her some weeks ago had been
followed by two fifty-pound notes. And yet, though
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;189]</span>
she knew poor Godfrey was quite unaware of it, her
original purpose&mdash;the purpose which had so distressed
him, and which, as she well knew, had induced
in him such extraordinary and unusual generosity&mdash;had
not faltered at all. Katty still meant to
cut the cable, and start a new life elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosedean was all very well; her close friendship
with Godfrey Pavely was all very well; though of
late she had been disagreeably aware that Godfrey
was ashamed&mdash;ashamed of giving her that money,
ashamed of his increasing fondness for her, ashamed
also of&mdash;well, of other little things which sometimes
happened, things which Katty thought quite unimportant,
which she regarded as part of the payment
due from her to Godfrey. But she realised more
rather than less, as time went on, that if she wanted
to make anything of her life there must come a
change. She would wait a while, wait perhaps till
next autumn&mdash;so she had told those kind friends of
hers, the Haworths.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was sometimes surprised to find how sorry
she was that things had not fallen out otherwise.
But she had always tried, in all the great things of
life, to look the truth squarely in the face. Only
once had she been caught doing anything else&mdash;and
that, as we know, had been years and years ago. She
was not likely to make that sort of mistake now. She
had come to see, with a rather painful clearness, that
Godfrey and Laura, however ill they got on together,
were not the sort of people to lend themselves to any
kind of juggling with the law to obtain their liberty.</p>

<p class="indent">But she had been disappointed in Oliver Tropenell.
She had felt in him accumulated forces of that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
explosive energy which leads to determined action&mdash;also
she had thought that Gillie would do something.</p>

<p class="indent">But the two had disappeared together almost immediately
after her talk with Laura's brother. That
was over ten weeks ago now, and neither had given
any sign of life since.</p>

<p class="indent">But Katty intended to keep up with Godfrey. For
one thing she was keenly interested in that business
in which they were, in a sense, both engaged. Also
one never can tell what life&mdash;and death&mdash;may not
bring forth. Whatever happened, the link between
herself and Godfrey was too strong ever to be broken.
Even if she married again, which she supposed she
would do some time or other, there seemed no reason,
to her, at any rate, why she should not keep up with
Godfrey. He was her trustee now, as well as her
oldest friend.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was that she had very willingly assented to
do him the trifling favour of spending some further
hours in his company.</p>

<p class="indent">As they wandered about the old city, and lingered
awhile in the great Minster, neither of them said
a word that the whole world might not have overheard.
They visited some of the curiosity shops for
which York is famed, and Katty's companion, with
that new generosity which sat on him so strangely,
bought a beautiful, and very costly, old cut-glass
pendant for Rosedean.</p>

<p class="indent">They did not meet a soul that either of them knew,
excepting, yes, stop&mdash;&mdash;After they had said goodbye
(Godfrey, with a rather shocked look on his
face, for Katty, imprudent, foolish Katty, had woman-like
seemed to expect that he would kiss her in a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;191]</span>
corner of an empty waiting-room where at any moment
they might have been surprised by some acquaintance
of one or the other of them!)&mdash;after, as
arranged, they had said good-bye, and Katty was engaged
in taking her ticket for the branch line station
for which she was bound, a curious thing happened.</p>

<p class="indent">She suddenly heard a voice, a man's voice, which
sounded pleasantly familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">Who could it be? The association evoked was
wholly agreeable, but Katty could not place, in the
chambers of her memory, the owner of the rather
peculiar accents which were engaged in asking when
the next train back to London would start.</p>

<p class="indent">She had turned round quickly, only to see a small
queue of people behind her, among them surely the
owner of that peculiar voice. But no, she did not
know any one there&mdash;though among them a man attracted
her attention, for the simple reason that he
was staring at her very hard. He was obviously a
foreigner, for his skin was olive-tinted, and he had
a small, black, pointed beard. He stared at Katty
with an air of rather insolent admiration. And then
he broke away from the queue, and walked quickly
off, out of the booking-office.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty always enjoyed admiration, whatever its
source, and yet a queer kind of shiver had gone
through her when this impertinent stranger's glance
rested full on her face. She had had the odious sensation
that the man saw something to be jeered at,
as well as admired, in her neat and attractive self.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At last, reluctantly, Katty got up and went into
her well-warmed comfortable bathroom. It was nice
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;192]</span>
to be home again, at no one's orders but her own.
After she had dressed, she rang, and very soon came
her breakfast, daintily served by the devoted Harber,
also the one daily paper she felt she could afford to
take.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was one of the many women to whom the
daily picture-paper supplied a long-felt, if unconscious,
want. It gave her just the amount of news, and the
kind of news, that her busy mind, absorbed in other
things, could assimilate comfortably. She was no
reader, though sometimes she would manage to gallop
through some book that all the world was talking
about. But newspapers had always bored her. Still,
she had become very fond of the paper she now held
in her hand. It only cost a halfpenny a day, and
Katty liked small, sensible economies.</p>

<p class="indent">That liking of hers was one of the links which
bound her to Godfrey Pavely, but unlike Godfrey,
Katty did not care for money for money's sake. She
only liked money for what money could buy. And
sometimes, when she was in a cheerful, mischievous
mood, she would tell herself, with a smile, that if
ever her Castle in Spain turned out to have been
built on a solid foundation&mdash;if ever, that is, she became
Godfrey Pavely's wife, she would know how
to spend the money he had garnered so carefully.
She felt pretty sure, deep in her heart, that should
such an unlikely thing come to pass, she would know
how to "manage" Godfrey, and that, if surprised,
he would not really mind what she did. She always
got good value out of everything she acquired, and
that would remain true if, instead of spending pence,
she was ever able to spend pounds.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;193]</span>
A little before eleven, just as Katty was beginning
to think it was time for her to finish dressing, she
heard the gate of her domain open, and the voice of
little Alice Pavely rise up through the still, frosty air,
mingling with the deeper, gentler tones of Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an odd thing, considering that the two
women were at any rate in theory intimate friends,
that Laura very, very seldom came to Rosedean. In
fact Katty could not remember a single time when
Laura had come in the morning, an uninvited, unexpected
guest. So suddenly poor Katty felt a little
chill of apprehension; she got up from her chair, and
waited....</p>

<p class="indent">The front door was opened at once. Then came
Harber's hurrying footfalls on the staircase&mdash;and,
simultaneously, the garden door at the back of the
house swung to. Laura had evidently sent her little
girl out of doors, into the garden. What could she
be coming to say?</p>

<p class="indent">Quickly Katty examined her conscience. No, there
was nothing that Laura could possibly have found
out. As to that half day spent with Godfrey in York,
Laura was surely the last woman to mind&mdash;and if she
did mind, she was quite the last woman to say anything
about it!</p>

<p class="indent">There came a knock at the door: then Harber's
voice, "Mrs. Pavely wants to know, ma'am, if she
can come up and speak to you, just for a minute."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ask Mrs. Pavely to come up," said Katty,
pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">A minute later, Laura walked forward into the
room. It was the first time she had been in Katty's
bedroom since Rosedean had been first furnished.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;194]</span>
She looked round her with a smile. "Why, Katty,"
she exclaimed, "how charming and pretty you've
made it all! You've added quite a number of things
since I was here last."</p>

<p class="indent">"Only the curtains," said Katty quickly (oh, how
relieved she felt!), "only the curtains, and perhaps
that arm-chair, Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I suppose that <i>is</i> all, but somehow it looks
more."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura looked exactly as she always looked, rather
paler perhaps than usual, but then Laura was pale.
She had that peculiar clear, warm whiteness of skin
that is compared by its admirers to a camellia; this
morning, her lovely, deep blue eyes looked tired, as if
she had been sleeping badly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've really come to ask if you know where Godfrey
is? We expected him home on Thursday. Then
he sent a telephone message saying that he couldn't
be back till yesterday. No time was mentioned, but
as he had a lot of appointments at the Bank we of
course thought he would be back early. I myself sat
up for him last night till after the last train, but now,
this morning, I've heard nothing from him&mdash;and Mr.
Privet has heard nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">"What an odd thing!" exclaimed Katty. She really
did think it very odd, for Godfrey was the most precise
of men.</p>

<p class="indent">She waited a moment, then said truthfully, "No,
I haven't the slightest idea where he is. He wrote
me a line late last week about a little investment of
mine. I've got the letter somewhere."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was trying to make up her mind as to whether
she should say anything concerning that joint journey
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;195]</span>
to York. At last she decided not to do so. It had
nothing to do with Godfrey's absence now.</p>

<p class="indent">"Doesn't Mr. Privet know where he is?" she asked.
"That really <i>is</i> very odd, Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course Mr. Privet knows where Godfrey was
up to Thursday morning. He stayed where he always
does stay when in London, at the Hungerford
Hotel, in Trafalgar Square. He's always stayed there&mdash;they
know him, and make him very comfortable.
But Mr. Privet telephoned through there yesterday&mdash;as
a matter of fact I've only just heard this&mdash;and
they told him that Godfrey had left the hotel on
Thursday morning. But the extraordinary thing is,"
and now Laura really did look somewhat troubled&mdash;"that
they were expecting him back there to pack, to
leave for here&mdash;at least so the manager understood
him to say. He went out in the morning, and then
he didn't come back, as they thought he would do,
to luncheon. All his things are still at the Hungerford
Hotel."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty began to feel a little uneasy. "Perhaps he's
had an accident," she said. "After all, accidents <i>do</i>
happen. Have you done anything, Laura?"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura shook her head. "What seems to make the
theory of an accident unlikely is that telephone message.
You see, he telephoned quite late on Thursday
saying that he would stay in town over the night.
But he didn't send a similar message to the Bank, as
any one knowing Godfrey would certainly have expected
him to do, and he didn't let them know at
the Hungerford Hotel that he would be away for
the night. It's all rather mysterious."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, it is," said Katty.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
"I wonder&mdash;" Laura grew a little pink&mdash;"I wonder,"
she said again, "if you know on what business
Godfrey went up to town? Mr. Privet would rather
like to know that."</p>

<p class="indent">And then Katty grew a little pink, too. She hesitated.
"No, I don't know what business took him
away. You forget that I myself have been away
for quite a long time&mdash;I only came back on Thursday
afternoon."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, of course!" exclaimed Laura. "I forgot
that. You've been away nearly a fortnight, haven't
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. First I went right down to the south, and
then up to Yorkshire."</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow she felt impelled to say this.</p>

<p class="indent">But Katty's visits were of no interest to Laura at
any time, least of all just now. "Well, I thought
I'd come and just ask you on the chance," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">She got up, and for a moment or two the two
young women stood together not far from the bow
window of Katty's bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Katty exclaimed, "Why, there's Oliver
Tropenell! What an extraordinary thing! I thought
he was abroad."</p>

<p class="indent">"He came back yesterday morning," said Laura
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty gave her visitor a quick, searching look.
But there was never anything to see in Laura's face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hadn't I better call out to him? He's evidently
on his way to The Chase. Hadn't I better say you're
here?"</p>

<p class="indent">And, as Laura seemed to hesitate, she threw open
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;197]</span>
the window. "Mr. Tropenell?" she called out, in her
clear, ringing voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The man who was striding past Rosedean, walking
very quickly, stopped rather unwillingly. Then he
looked up, and when he saw who it was that was
standing by Mrs. Winslow, he turned in through the
gate, and rang the door-bell.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go down to him, Laura? I can't come
as I am."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll wait while you put on your dress. We can
tell him to go out into the garden with Alice."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent over the broad, low bar of the window,
and Oliver, gazing up at her, thought of Rossetti's
lines: Heaven to him was where Laura was.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go through the house into the garden?
Alice is there. We'll be down soon."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty lingered a little, though she only had to put
on her blouse, her skirt, and a sports coat. "I feel
quite anxious about Godfrey," she said hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">And Laura, in an absent voice, said, "Yes, so do
I. But of course by this time he may be at the Bank.
He's quite fond of that very early morning train. He
often took it last summer."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, but now he would have had to get up in the
dark to take it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't think Godfrey would mind that."</p>

<p class="indent">At last the two went downstairs, and out into the
garden where Oliver Tropenell and the child were
talking together.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver turned round, and after shaking hands with
Mrs. Winslow, he asked Laura an abrupt question.
"Did Godfrey come back last evening after all?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
Katty looked at him inquisitively. Then he had
been at The Chase yesterday?</p>

<p class="indent">Laura shook her head. "No, I sat up for him till
midnight. I thought it almost certain that he'd taken
the last train. But we've had no news of him at all.
Perhaps he's at the Bank by now&mdash;I'll ring up as
soon as I get home. Come, Alice, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty heard Oliver Tropenell say in a low voice:
"May I walk with you?"</p>

<p class="indent">And then Katty cut in: "You'll let me know,
Laura, won't you, if you have any special news? Of
course I don't want you to let me know if Godfrey's
safe at the Bank&mdash;I'm not so anxious as all that!"
She laughed, her rather affected, little ringing laugh.
"But if there's any other news&mdash;especially if he's had
an accident of any sort&mdash;well, I <i>should</i> like to know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I'll send you word." And then Laura
roused herself. "Why shouldn't you come up to
lunch, Katty? I wish you would! And then I could
tell you anything I've heard this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, I'd like to do that. I'll follow you in
about an hour. I've things to do, and letters to write,
now."</p>

<p class="indent">She saw the three off, and once more, as had so
often been the case in the past, her heart was filled
with envy&mdash;envy, and a certain excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell's return home just now was a
complication. She felt sure it would upset Godfrey,
but she could not quite tell how much. She wondered
if Gilbert Baynton had come back too. She rather
hoped that he had.</p>

<p class="indent">She wrote her letters, and then, so timing her departure
as to arrive exactly at one o'clock, for at The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
Chase luncheon was at one, she went off, meeting, as
she expected to do, Oliver Tropenell on his way home
to Freshley.</p>

<p class="indent">"Any news?" she called out. And he shook his
head. "No&mdash;no news at all." Then he added slowly:
"But I don't see that there's any cause for alarm.
Pavely telephoned the day before yesterday saying
he was being detained in town."</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, it's odd he didn't write to Laura," said Katty
meditatively. "As a rule he writes to Laura every
day when he is in London."</p>

<p class="indent">She knew that was one of those half-truths which
are more misleading than a lie. Godfrey was fond
of sending home postcards containing directions as
to this or that connected with the house or garden.
But Katty saw the instinctive frown which came over
Oliver Tropenell's face, and she felt pleased. She
enjoyed giving this odd, sensitive, secretive man tiny
pin-pricks. She had never really liked him, and now
she positively disliked him. Why had he gone away
just when things were looking promising? And, having
gone away for so long, why had he now come
back?</p>

<p class="indent">"How is Mr. Baynton?" she asked, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"He's gone back to Mexico."</p>

<p class="indent">And now Katty was really surprised. "Has he
indeed?" she exclaimed. "And without seeing Laura
again? I'm rather sorry for <i>that</i>!" And as Oliver
made no answer, she went on a trifle maliciously: "I
suppose you will be going off soon, too?"</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated, a very long time it seemed to her,
before he answered, "Yes, I suppose I shall. But
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
things go on all right over there as long as one of
us is there."</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with a not over civil abruptness, he left her.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty stayed most of that cold wintry Saturday
afternoon with Laura, and as was her way when
she chose to do so, she made herself very pleasant to
both the mother and child, and that though little
Alice did not like her.</p>

<p class="indent">A little before four she asked Laura if she might
telephone herself to the Bank, and Laura eagerly
assented.</p>

<p class="indent">Explaining that she was really speaking for Mrs.
Pavely, Katty had quite a long chat with Mr. Privet.
She and the old head clerk had always been good
friends, though they met seldom. He could remember
her as a beautiful child, and then as the popular,
because the always good humoured and pleasant-spoken,
belle of Pewsbury.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I feel very anxious indeed, Mrs. Winslow!
I've been wondering whether it wouldn't be a good
thing to communicate with the London police, if
we don't have any news of Mr. Pavely to-morrow.
Could you ascertain for me the exact feelings of Mrs.
Pavely?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I agree with you, Mr. Privet, for after all, accidents
<i>do</i> happen! Hold the line a moment. I'll go
and inquire."</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried off to Laura's boudoir. "Mr. Privet
suggests that the London police should be communicated
with&mdash;if we don't have news of Godfrey by
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura looked up, startled. "Oh, Katty, don't you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
think that would make him very angry&mdash;if he's all
right, I mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps it would," Katty agreed uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="indent">She went back to the telephone. "Mrs. Pavely
thinks we'd better wait a little longer before saying
anything to the police," she called out.</p>

<p class="indent">And thus it was through Laura, as Katty reminded
herself in days to come, that two more precious days
were lost.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="cap">"WELL, my dear&mdash;any more news?" But even
as Mrs. Tropenell, looking up from her breakfast-table,
asked the question, she knew what the
answer would be.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the following Monday morning. The post
had just come in, and at once, knowing that the
postman called first at The Chase, Oliver had hurried
off to the telephone. He had been there a long time&mdash;perhaps
as long as ten minutes&mdash;and when he came
back into the dining-room his mother was struck
afresh by the look of almost intolerable strain and
anxiety in his face and eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">They had spent a great part of Sunday with Laura,
and during that long, trying day Mrs. Tropenell had
felt very much more concerned about her son than
she did about Godfrey Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">Godfrey, so she told herself, with a touch of unreason
not usual with her, would almost certainly
turn up all right&mdash;even if, as she was inclined to believe
possible, he had met with some kind of accident.
But Oliver, her beloved, the only human being
in the world that really mattered to her&mdash;what was
wrong with him? Long after she had gone to bed
each evening she had heard him, during the last three
nights, wandering restlessly about the house.</p>

<p class="indent">After the first almost painful rush of joy which
had come over her when he had suddenly walked into
her presence last Thursday night, she had regretted,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;203]</span>
with unceasing bitter regret, his return home. It was
so horribly apparent to her, his mother, that Laura,
<i>belle dame sans merci</i>, held him in thrall.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you don't mind, mother, I think I shall go up
to town to-day and see the Scotland Yard people. I
think&mdash;don't you?&mdash;it would-be a comfort to Laura."
There was a harassed, questioning note in his voice
which surprised Mrs. Tropenell. As a rule Oliver
always knew exactly what he meant to do.</p>

<p class="indent">She answered slowly, reluctantly (she hated so
much his being mixed up in this odd, mysterious matter
of Godfrey's temporary disappearance!): "Perhaps
it would be. Still, I think Laura ought to communicate
with Godfrey's cousins. Of course I know
he didn't care for them. Still, after all, those people
are his only near relations."</p>

<p class="indent">"That old Mr. Privet, Pavely's confidential clerk,
is going up to town to-day," observed Oliver inconsequently.
"I thought he and I might travel together,
and that while he goes to the hotel, I can go to Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p class="indent">And then Mrs. Tropenell roused herself to try and
give what help she could.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord St. Amant knows the new Commissioner of
Police very well," she said. "They met in India.
Ask him to give you a note of introduction, Oliver.
He's in town just now, you would certainly find him,
either at his rooms or at his club."</p>

<p class="indent">There came a faint flush over her face. By her
plate there lay Lord St. Amant's daily letter. On
Mondays London letters always arrived by the second
post, but yesterday her old friend had had a
late-fee stamp put on his letter, so that she might
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
get it the first thing this morning. He had suggested
that Sir Angus Kinross&mdash;that was the name of the
new Commissioner&mdash;should be approached. He had
even offered&mdash;and it was good of him, for he hated
taking trouble and he had always disliked Godfrey
Pavely&mdash;to go to Scotland Yard himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was still standing, though his breakfast was
only half eaten, and he was looking at his mother
with that rather impatient, strained look on his face
to which she had by now become accustomed. "That's
a good idea," he said. And she felt glad that any
idea proposed by her should seem to be good. Yesterday
her son, who was always so kindly, so respectful
in his manner to her, had&mdash;yes, snubbed her&mdash;when
she had proposed something which it had seemed to
her would be of use.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I'll go over to The Chase now, mother.
It's impossible to say all that one wants to say over
the telephone."</p>

<p class="indent">She said nervously, "Won't you finish your breakfast?"
and to her surprise he obeyed her. To her
surprise also, when at last he did get up he seemed
in no great hurry to go.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I come with you, my darling?" she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head. "No, mother. I'd rather discuss
the matter with her alone, but I'll make her
come over as early as I can. You know she said she
would bring Alice to lunch to-day." And then, looking
straight down into her troubled face, he asked:
"Mother? What do <i>you</i> think has happened to Godfrey
Pavely?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was the first time he had asked her the direct
question.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
"I don't know what to think! But I suppose the
most probable thing is&mdash;that he's had an accident.
After all, people do meet with bad accidents, especially
in wintry, foggy weather, in the London streets.
If so, he may be lying unconscious in one of the big
hospitals. I can't think why the London police
shouldn't have been told of his disappearance on Friday&mdash;that,
as I told Laura yesterday, is the first thing
I should have done myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Both Mrs. Winslow and Laura seemed to think he
would dislike that so very much," said Oliver slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a defensive note in his voice, for he had
made no effort to back up his mother when she had
strongly counselled Laura to communicate with Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Has it ever occurred to you," he said suddenly,
"that Pavely may be dead, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Oliver. That I confess has not occurred to
me. In fact, I regard it as extremely unlikely."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why that?" he asked in a hard voice. "People
are often killed in street accidents." Then, after a
minute's pause: "Do you think Laura would mind
much?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it would give her a great shock!" She
added, hesitatingly. "They have been getting on
rather better than usual&mdash;at least so it has seemed to
me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have they indeed?"</p>

<p class="indent">His words cut like a whip, and she got up and went
and stood by him. "My son," she said very solemnly.
"Oh, my darling, don't allow yourself to wish&mdash;to
hope&mdash;for Godfrey Pavely's death!"</p>

<p class="indent">Looking straight into her face, he exclaimed, "I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
can't help it, mother! I do hope, I do wish, for
Godfrey Pavely's death&mdash;with all the strength, with
all the power that is in me. Why should I be hypocritical&mdash;with
you? Am I the first man that has committed
murder," he waited a moment&mdash;"in his heart?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If that be really so&mdash;then don't let it ever be
suspected, Oliver! For God's sake, try and look differently
from what you have looked the last few
days! If your wish is to be granted, your hope satisfied,
then don't let any one suspect that the hope or
the wish was ever there!"</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke with an intensity of feeling and passion
equal to his own.</p>

<p class="indent">"You're right, mother," he said in a low voice. "I
know you're right! And I promise you that I'll try
and follow your advice. No man ever had a wiser
and a better mother than I!"</p>

<p class="indent">He turned round quickly and left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell did not see her son again till late
that night, and then not alone, for Laura spent the
evening at Freshley, and after he had taken their
guest home to The Chase, he did not come in again
for hours.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Mr. Privet, Godfrey Pavely's confidential
clerk, had been rather taken aback when he had learnt
over the telephone, from Mrs. Pavely, that he was
to have Mr. Oliver Tropenell as his travelling companion
to London. But very soon, being a truly religious
man, he came to see how well and wisely
everything had been ordered. To begin with, Mr.
Tropenell called for him at the Bank, thus saving
him a very cold, easterly-wind kind of walk to Pewsbury
station, which was some way from the town.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
And once there, Mr. Tropenell had taken two first-class
return tickets&mdash;that again being the action of a
true gentleman, for he, Mr. Privet, would have been
quite content to go by himself third-class. Also, as
it turned out, during the long journey to London
they had some very pleasant and instructive conversation
together.</p>

<p class="indent">Quite at first, in answer to a query as to what he
thought of this extraordinary business of Mr. Pavely's
disappearance, Mr. Oliver Tropenell had been
perhaps a little short. He had replied that no one
could possibly venture an opinion as to what had happened.
But then had followed between them, in spite
of the fact that the noise of the train was very trying,
a most agreeable chat over old times&mdash;over those
days when Mr. Godfrey Pavely's father, a fine type
of the old country-town banker, was still alive.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Privet, as a younger man, had had a good deal
to do with the final sale and purchase of The Chase,
and Mr. Tropenell, as was very natural in one whose
own ancestors had lived there for hundreds of years,
had shown the greatest interest in that old story. Mr.
Tropenell had not been in the least over-curious or
indiscreet, but Mr. Privet had been led on to talk
of his companion's grandfather, a gentleman who, if
rather wild, and certainly extravagant and headstrong,
had been such a grand sportsman&mdash;quite a hero
among the young men of Pewsbury! What had
brought about the poor gentleman's undoing had been
his taking over the hounds, when Lord St. Amant's
great-uncle had given them up.</p>

<p class="indent">So pleasant had been that conversation in the first-class
carriage shared by them, that for the first time
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span>
since Thursday Mr. Privet had almost forgotten the
business on which they two were going to London!
But he had soon remembered it again&mdash;for at the
station Mr. Oliver Tropenell had suggested that, instead
of going to the Hungerford Hotel, he, Mr.
Privet, should accompany him to Lord St. Amant's
club, in order to get a letter of introduction from that
nobleman to the Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p class="indent">Not long ago Mr. Privet had read an interesting
book called <i>In London Club Land</i>. But he had little
thought, when he was reading that book, that he
would ever see the famous old political club to which
a whole chapter had been devoted, and to which so
many of his own special political heroes had belonged
in their time!</p>

<p class="indent">And then, after Lord St. Amant, who also had
treated Mr. Privet with rather exceptional civility,
not to say courtesy, had written the letter, Mr.
Tropenell suggested that they should go straight on
to Scotland Yard&mdash;pointing out, what was true
enough, that Mr. Privet knew far more of Mr. Godfrey
Pavely's business and habits than any one else.</p>

<p class="indent">And so, together, they had driven off in a taxi&mdash;also
a new, agreeable experience to Mr. Privet&mdash;to
the famous Bastille-like building on the Thames
Embankment.</p>

<p class="indent">But when there, the interview with the pleasant-spoken,
genial gentleman who wielded such immense
powers had been disappointing.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus Kinross had listened very carefully to
all that he, Mr. Privet, had had to say, and he had
asked a number of acute, clever questions of both his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
visitors. But very soon he had observed that he
feared much valuable time had been lost.</p>

<p class="indent">Later on, Mr. Privet, when he thought the interview
over, could almost hear the voice of Sir Angus
repeating slowly, inexorably: "Thursday? And it's
now Monday afternoon! What a misfortune it is
that Mrs.&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;Mrs. Pavely, did not communicate
with us at once. If she had telephoned, here,
when she first began to realise that there was something
strange in her husband's prolonged absence, she
would almost certainly have had some sort of news
by now."</p>

<p class="indent">And then he, Mr. Privet, had answered quickly,
"But we didn't begin to feel anxious till the Friday,
sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I quite understand that! But if you, Mr.&mdash;ah yes&mdash;Mr.
Privet&mdash;had written then, we could have begun
our inquiries on the Saturday morning. Did it
not occur to you to let the London police know of
Mr. Pavely's non-appearance?"</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Mr. Privet had felt vaguely uncomfortable,
for his questioner had given him such a
very odd, keen look, as he asked that simple question.
But he had answered, honestly enough, for after all
'Tho' truth may be blamed, it can never be shamed':
"Mr. Pavely, sir, did not like to be interfered with
when he was away on business, and we thought it
would annoy him if we were to make too great a fuss.
Once, many years ago now&mdash;Mr. Pavely went over to
Paris for some days, and omitted to leave his address
at the Bank. I couldn't help remembering last week
that Mr. Pavely, on that former occasion, had seemed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
somewhat put out with me for expressing what I
thought at the time a very natural anxiety, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">They hadn't been very long at Scotland Yard, a
little under half an hour in all, and during the last
ten minutes a shorthand writer had made some notes
of the conversation, which, indeed, had been almost
entirely carried on between him, Mr. Privet, and the
Commissioner of Police. Mr. Oliver Tropenell, as
was bound to be the case, had had very little to say,
seeing that he was there merely as Mrs. Pavely's representative,
she having her only brother in Mexico.</p>

<p class="indent">After leaving Scotland Yard they had gone on to
the Hungerford Hotel, and there a lot of information
had been afforded them. But it hadn't amounted to
very much&mdash;when all was said and done! They already
knew that all trace of Mr. Pavely had disappeared
after eleven o'clock on the Thursday morning.
His room was even now exactly as he had left
it; neat, for he was always a most particular gentleman,
but with nothing put away. In fact the only
news of him after that morning had been that telephone
message to The Chase&mdash;a message given by
some one, the butler by now wasn't even sure if it
was a man or a woman, who was evidently in a
great hurry.</p>

<p class="indent">One thing the manager of the hotel had done
which had rather surprised and shocked both Mr.
Privet and his companion. He had consulted a detective
about the affair, and, at Mr. Tropenell's request,
the detective was sent for.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Privet had thought this secret inquiry agent
(as he called himself) a queer kind of chap&mdash;in fact
he had seemed much more anxious to ascertain if
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
a reward was going to be offered, than to offer any
useful advice as to this perplexing matter of Mr.
Pavely's disappearance.</p>

<p class="indent">He had, however, seemed to think that the Thursday
evening telephone call was very important, and
he had asked permission to come down to The Chase
to cross-examine the servant who had taken the message.
But that&mdash;so Mr. Tropenell had very properly
said&mdash;was impossible, now that the matter had been
placed in the hands of Scotland Yard. In answer
to Mr. Privet's natural curiosity as to why the detective
thought that telephone call so important, the
man had answered, rather crossly: "You see, there's
no record kept of telephone calls! There's a record
kept of telegrams, so one can always recover the
original of a telegram."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Tropenell had been quite surprised on hearing
this.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should have thought telephone calls quite as
important as telegrams?" he had exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"So they are, with regard to <i>my</i> kind of work,"
the man had replied. "But even with regard to
trunk-calls you've only got to go into a Post Office
and plank down your money and wait till you're
through! Still, the young woman at your country
Exchange would probably have remembered the call
if she had been asked sooner. But it's all such a
long time ago."</p>

<p class="indent">A long time ago? What nonsense! He, Mr.
Privet, felt quite put out with this detective, and he
began to see why Mr. Tropenell thought the man
ought not to have been brought into the business at
all. It was certainly rather cool of the hotel manager
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
to have gone and brought such a person into the
affair, without asking Mr. Pavely's friends if he
was at liberty to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">They had managed to catch the six o'clock express
back to Pewsbury, and then Mr. Tropenell very kindly
insisted on driving Mr. Privet home. Mr. and Mrs.
Privet owned a pretty, old-fashioned house on the
other side of the town. When Mr. Privet had married&mdash;a
matter of forty years ago now&mdash;he had made
up his mind that it would do him good to be obliged
to take a good walk to and from the Bank every day.</p>

<p class="indent">On their arrival at the house&mdash;which, funnily
enough, was called Southbank&mdash;Mr. Tropenell, at the
request of Mr. Privet, had come in for a few minutes
to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Privet. He had
said how much he liked their house, how much prettier
it was, how much more dignified&mdash;that had been
his curious word&mdash;than the red brick villas which
had sprung up all over the outskirts of their beautiful
old town. And Mr. Privet had been secretly
rather pleased, for lately "Mother"&mdash;as he called Mrs.
Privet&mdash;had become somewhat restless, being impressed
by certain improvements those gimcrack villas
possessed, which their house lacked, and that though
he had put in a nice bathroom a matter of twenty
years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, of the several people who, that day, had been
engaged in trying to probe the mystery of Godfrey
Pavely's disappearance, the only one who found a
great deal of natural pleasure and simple enjoyment
out of it all was Mr. Privet; and he, alone of them all,
really cared for the missing man, and, perhaps, alone
of them all, had a genuine longing to see him again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
Mr. Privet thought it was particularly kind of Mr.
Oliver Tropenell to be taking all this trouble for poor
Mrs. Pavely; though of course he, Mr. Privet, was
well aware that Mrs. Pavely's brother was partner
to Mr. Tropenell in Mexico. He knew the sad truth&mdash;the
sad truth, that is, as to the disgraceful circumstances
under which Gilbert Baynton had had to leave
England. No one else in the Bank had known&mdash;at
least he and Mr. Pavely hoped not. It had been very,
very fortunate that the forged signature had been
on one of their own cheques. But for that fact,
nothing could have saved that good-for-nothing
scoundrel&mdash;so Mr. Privet always called Gillie Baynton
in his own mind&mdash;from a prosecution.</p>

<p class="indent">Do any of us ever think, reader, of the way in
which our most secret business is known, nay, must
be known, to a certain number of people of whose
existence we ourselves are scarcely aware?</p>

<p class="indent">Laura, when she came and talked, as she sometimes
did talk, kindly, if a little indifferently, to her
husband's confidential clerk, would have been disagreeably
surprised had she been able to see into Mr.
Privet's heart and mind. As for Godfrey Pavely,
nothing would have made him credit, high as was his
opinion of Mr. Privet's business acumen, the fact
that his clerk had a very shrewd suspicion where those
three hundred pounds in notes, lately drawn out by
his employer for his own personal use, had made
their way....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="cap">IT was the morning of the 15th of January, and
already Godfrey Pavely's disappearance had excited
more than the proverbial nine days' wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura had gone to her boudoir after breakfast,
and she was waiting there, sitting at her writing-table,
feeling wretchedly anxious and excited, for all
last night she had had a curious, insistent presentiment
that at last something was going to happen. She
had sent Alice off to her lessons, for there was no
object in allowing the child to idle as she had idled
during that first bewildering week.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she got up, pushed her chair aside, and went
and lay down on a sofa. She felt very, very tired;
worn out partly by suspense and anxiety, partly by
the many interviews with strangers she had been compelled
to have during the last ten days.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell was again in London, and since
he had left Freshley, for the second time, it was as
though a strong, protecting arm on which she leant
had suddenly been withdrawn from her. And yet
she knew that he was engaged upon her business, upon
this extraordinary, unutterably strange business of
her husband's disappearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver wrote to her daily&mdash;brief, coldly-worded
notes describing what had been, and was being, done
both by the police and by the big firm of private detectives
who were now also engaged in a search for the
missing man. But there was very little to report&mdash;so
far every one was completely baffled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
Against the wish and advice of both Oliver
Tropenell and the Scotland Yard authorities, Laura
had offered a reward of a thousand pounds for any information
which would lead to the discovery of Godfrey
Pavely, alive or dead. It had been Katty's suggestion,
and Laura, somehow, had not liked to disregard
it.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, to-day, Laura, as she moved restlessly
this way and that, told herself that she was sorry she
had assented to a suggestion that Katty Winslow
should come and stay with her during those long days
of waiting which were at once so dreary and so full
of excitement and suspense. Katty had got hopelessly
on Laura's nerves. Katty could not keep silent,
Katty could not keep still.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Winslow, in a sense, had taken possession of
The Chase. It was she who saw to everything, who
examined every letter, who went and answered the
telephone when the police either at Pewsbury or from
London rang up. She was apparently in a state of
great excitement and of great anxiety, and some of
the critics in the servants' wing said to each other
with a knowing smile that Mrs. Winslow might have
been Mrs. Pavely, so much did that lady take Mr.
Pavely's disappearance to heart!</p>

<p class="indent">Katty had not seemed as worried as Laura had
seemed the first two or three days, but now she appeared
even more upset. Yesterday she had admitted
to sleepless nights, and the hostess had felt greatly
relieved when her guest had at last confessed that if
dear Laura would not mind she would like to stay in
bed every morning up to eleven o'clock; nothing ever
happened before then.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
The only person with whom Laura, during those
long, dreary days, felt comparatively at ease was Mrs.
Tropenell, for Mrs. Tropenell seemed to understand
exactly what she, poor Laura, was feeling during
those miserable days of waiting for news that did not
come. But Laura did not see very much of the older
woman&mdash;not nearly as much as she would have liked
to do just now, for Mrs. Tropenell disliked Katty,
and avoided meeting her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The stable clock struck ten. And Laura suddenly
heard the sound of firm steps hurrying down the passage.
She got off the sofa, expecting to see the now
disagreeably familiar blue uniform and flat blue cap
of the Pewsbury Police Inspector. He came up to
see her almost every day, but he had never come quite
so early as this morning.</p>

<p class="indent">She gathered herself together to answer with calm
civility his tiresome, futile questions. There was
nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>&mdash;she could say that she had not
said already as to Godfrey's usual habits, and as to
his probable business interests outside Pewsbury.
The Inspector had been surprised, though he had
tried to hide the fact, to find that Mrs. Pavely knew
so very little of her husband's business interests and
concerns. The last two times he had been there Katty
had been present, and she had been very useful&mdash;useful
and tactful. Laura, feeling rather ashamed of
her late uncharitable thoughts concerning Katty,
wished that Katty could be present at the coming
interview, but unfortunately Katty was still in bed.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and she stood up expectantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
It was only Preston, the butler. There was a large
envelope on the salver he held in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's from the Bank, ma'am. Marked 'Urgent,'"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there an answer?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">And he hesitated. "We have kept the messenger,
ma'am."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura knew Mr. Privet's small, neat handwriting&mdash;if
he marked an envelope "Urgent," then it was
urgent.</p>

<p class="indent">There were two enclosures&mdash;a note and a letter.</p>

<p class="indent">She first read the note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Pavely</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">"I found the enclosed on my arrival at the Bank
this morning. It may be important, so I send it on
at once.</p>

<p class="indent">"And let me take this opportunity, dear Madam,
of assuring you of my very sincere sympathy. I,
too, have known during the last few days what it
was to feel that hope deferred maketh the heart sick.</p>

<p class="margin-left8">"Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="margin-left16">"<span class="smcap">David Privet</span>."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">She turned, with only languid interest, to the envelope.
The address was typewritten:&mdash;</p>

<p class="smcnomargins">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mrs. G. Pavely,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">c/o Messrs. Pavely &amp; Co.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Bankers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Pewsbury.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="indent">It was marked "Private," "Immediate," but that,
as Laura well knew, meant very little. A certain
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
number of times, perhaps half a dozen times in all,
during her married life, some unfortunate, humble
client of her husband's had written to her a personal
appeal. Each of these letters had been of a
painful and disagreeable nature, often couched in
pitiful, eloquent terms, and Godfrey had not allowed
her to answer any one of them save in the most formal,
cold way.</p>

<p class="indent">This typewritten envelope looked as if it might
have come from some distressed tradesman. So she
opened the envelope reluctantly, not taking heed, as
a different type of woman would have done, to the
postmark on it. Indeed, without thinking of what
she was doing, she threw the envelope mechanically
into the burning fire, and then opened out the large
sheet of thin paper.</p>

<p class="indent">But, as she looked down at the lines of typewriting,
she stiffened into instant, palpitating, horrified
attention, for this is what she saw there:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;It is with the deepest regret that I
acquaint you with the fact that your esteemed husband,
Mr. Godfrey Pavely, of Messrs. Pavely &amp; Co.,
Bankers, of Pewsbury, Wiltshire, is dead.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you will instruct the police to go to Duke
House, Piccadilly, and proceed to Room 18 on the top
floor&mdash;the only office which is at present let&mdash;they
will find there Mr. Pavely's body.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am connected with important business interests
in Portugal, and for some time I have been in business
relations with Mr. Pavely. This fact you will
easily confirm by searching among his papers. I am
also, of course, well known at Duke House, for I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span>
have had an office there for a considerable number
of weeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"The tragedy&mdash;for a tragedy it is from my point
of view as well as from that of Mr. Pavely's unfortunate
family&mdash;fell out in this wise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Pavely came to see me (by appointment) on
the Thursday before last. There was a pistol lying
on my desk. I foolishly took it up and began playing
with it. I was standing just behind Mr. Pavely
when suddenly the trigger went off, and to my intense
horror the unfortunate man received the charge.
I thought&mdash;I hoped&mdash;that he was only wounded, but
all too soon I saw that he was undoubtedly dead&mdash;dead
by my hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I at first intended, and perhaps I should have been
wise in carrying out my first intention, to call in the
police&mdash;but very urgent business was requiring my
presence in Lisbon. Also I remembered that I had
no one who could, in England, vouch for my respectability,
though you will be further able to judge of
the truth of my story by going to the Mayfair Hotel,
where I have sometimes stayed, and by making inquiries
of the agent from whom I took the office in
Duke House.</p>

<p class="indent">"My relations with Mr. Pavely were slight, but
entirely friendly, even cordial, and what has happened
is a very terrible misfortune for me.</p>

<p class="indent">"I came to England in order to raise a loan for
a big and important business enterprise. Some
French banking friends introduced me to Mr. Pavely,
and I soon entered on good relations with him. Our
business was on the point of completion, and in a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;220]</span>
sense mutually agreeable to us, when what I may
style our fatal interview took place.</p>

<p class="margin-left8">"Yours with respectful sympathy,</p>

<p class="margin-left16">"<span class="smcap">Fernando Apra.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Laura sat down on the sofa. For the first time in
her life she felt faint and giddy, and during the few
moments that followed the reading of the extraordinary
letter she still held in her hand, it was, oddly
enough, her peculiar physical state which most absorbed
her astonished and anguished mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Then her brain gradually cleared. Godfrey&mdash;dead?
The thought was horrible&mdash;horrible! It made
her feel like a murderess. She remembered, with a
sensation of terrible self-rebuke and shame, the feeling
of almost hatred she had so often allowed herself
to feel for her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, before she had had time to gather her
mind together sufficiently to face the immediate problem
as to how she was to deal with this sinister letter,
the door again opened, and Katty Winslow came into
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty looked ill as well as worried. There were
dark circles round her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Laura! Whatever is the matter? Have you
heard anything? Have you news of Godfrey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have just had this. Oh, Katty, prepare for bad
news!"</p>

<p class="indent">But Katty hardly heard the words. She snatched
the tough, thin sheet of paper out of Laura's hand,
and going across to the window she began reading,
her back turned to Laura and the room.</p>

<p class="indent">For what seemed a long time she said nothing.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Then, at last, she moved slowly round. "Well," she
said stonily, "what are you going to do about it? If
I were you, Laura, I shouldn't let that stupid Pewsbury
inspector see this letter. I should go straight
up to London with it." She glanced at the clock.
"We've time to take the 11.20 train&mdash;if you hurry!"</p>

<p class="indent">She felt as if she would like to shake Laura&mdash;Laura,
standing helplessly there, looking at her, mute
anguish&mdash;yes, real anguish, in her deep, luminous
blue eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I were you," repeated Katty in a hoarse, urgent
tone, "I should go straight with this letter to Scotland
Yard. It's much too serious to fiddle about with
here! We want to know at once whether what this
man says is true or false&mdash;and that's the only way
you can find out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you wouldn't tell anybody here?" asked
Laura uncertainly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No. If I were you I shouldn't tell any one but
the London police. It may be a stupid, cruel hoax."</p>

<p class="indent">Deep in her heart Katty had at once believed the
awful, incredible story contained in the letter she
still held in her hand, for she, of course, was familiar
with the name of Fernando Apra, and knew that the
man's account of himself was substantially true.</p>

<p class="indent">But even so, she hoped against hope that it was, as
she had just said, a stupid, cruel hoax&mdash;the work
perchance of some spiteful clerk of this Portuguese
company promoter, with whose schemes both she and
Godfrey had been so taken&mdash;so, so fascinated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I'll go to town with you," she said
rapidly. "Let's go up <i>now</i>, and dress at once. I'll
order the car."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
There was a kind of driving power in Katty. Her
face was now very pale, as if all the pretty colour
was drained out of it. But she was quite calm, quite
collected. She seemed to feel none of the bewildered
oppression which Laura felt, but that, so the other
reminded herself, was natural. Katty, after all, was
not Godfrey's wife, or&mdash;or was it widow?</p>

<p class="indent">The two went upstairs, and Katty came in and
helped Laura to dress. "It will only make a fuss
and delay if you ring for your maid." She even
found, and insisted on Laura putting on, a big warm
fur coat which she had not yet had out this winter.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'd better just tell the servants here that you
think there may be a clue. It's no good making too
great a mystery. They can send on some message
of the sort to the Bank; also, if you like, to Mrs.
Tropenell."</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later Laura found herself in the
car, and the two were being driven quickly to Pewsbury
station.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I wire to Oliver Tropenell that we are coming?"
asked Katty suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">And Laura answered, dully, "No. He's in York
to-day. They've found out that Godfrey went to
York during that week we know he was in London.
I only heard of that this morning, or I would have
told you."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura will never forget that journey to London,
that long, strange, unreal journey, so filled with a
sort of terror, as well as pain. Somehow she could
not bring herself to believe that Godfrey was dead.</p>

<p class="indent">When they were about half-way there, Katty suddenly
exclaimed, "Let me look at that letter again!"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
And then, when Laura had taken it out of her bag,
she asked, "Where's the envelope? The envelope's
very important, you know!"</p>

<p class="indent">Laura looked at her helplessly. "I don't know. I
can't remember. I've a sort of an idea that I threw
the envelope into the fire."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Laura! What a very, very foolish thing to
do! Don't you see there must have been a postmark
on the envelope? Can't you remember anything
about it? What was the handwriting like?"</p>

<p class="indent">Again she felt she would like to shake Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">"The address was typewritten&mdash;I do remember
that. I thought&mdash;I don't know what I thought&mdash;I
can't remember now what I did think. It looked like
a circular, or a bill. But it was marked 'Urgent and
Confidential'&mdash;or something to that effect."</p>

<p class="indent">On their arrival in London a piece of good fortune
befell Laura Pavely. Lord St. Amant had been
in the same train, and when he saw her on the platform
he at once put himself at her disposal. "Scotland
Yard? I'll take you there myself. But Sir
Angus Kinross would be out just now. It's no good
going there till half-past two&mdash;at the earliest. I
hope you'll both honour me by coming to luncheon
in my rooms."</p>

<p class="indent">Reached by an arch set between two houses in St.
James's Street, and unknown to the majority of the
people who daily come and go through that historic
thoroughfare, is a tiny square&mdash;perhaps the smallest
open space in London&mdash;formed by eight to ten
eighteenth-century houses. But for the lowness of
the houses, this curious little spot might be a bit of
old Paris, a backwater of the Temple quarter, beyond
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
the Louvre and the Htel de Ville, which only
those tourists who have a passion either for Madame
de Svign or for the young Victor Hugo ever penetrate.</p>

<p class="indent">It was there that Lord St. Amant, some forty years
back, when he was still quite a young man, had found
a set of four panelled rooms exactly to his liking.
And through the many vicissitudes which had befallen
the funny little square, he had always contrived to
preserve these rooms, though at last, in order to do
so, he had had to become the leaseholder of the house
of which they formed a part. But he kept the fact
of this ownership to himself and to his lawyers, and
it was through the latter that the other rooms&mdash;the
ground floor and the top floor&mdash;were let to various
quiet, humble folk. His lawyers also, had found for
him the intelligent couple who acted as his caretakers,
and who managed to make him extremely comfortable
during the comparatively short periods he spent
in London each year.</p>

<p class="indent">Although his club was within a minute's walk, Lord
St. Amant, very soon after his first occupancy of
these rooms, had so arranged matters that, when he
chose to order it, a cold luncheon or dinner could be
sent in at a quarter of an hour's notice. And to-day
the arrangement, of which he very rarely availed himself,
stood him in good stead.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">There are a certain number of people who go
through life instinctively taking every chance of advancement
or of useful friendship offered to them.
Such a person was Katty Winslow.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in the midst of her real sorrow and distress,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
she did not lose sight of the fact that Lord St. Amant,
with whom her acquaintance up to the present had
been so slight as to be negligible, might prove a very
useful friend in what now looked like her immediately
dreary future. She was well aware that he was
probably, nay, almost certainly, prejudiced against
her, for she and Mrs. Tropenell had never been on
cordial terms; but she set herself, even now, with this
terrible thing which she feared, nay, felt almost sure,
was true, filling up the whole background of her mind,
to destroy that prejudice. To a certain extent she
succeeded, during the few minutes, the precious ten
minutes, she secured practically alone with her host,
in compassing her wish.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura sat down, in the attractive, if rather dark,
sitting-room into which Lord St. Amant had shown
her, and, blind to everything about her, she was now
staring into the fire, oppressed, stunned, by the terrible
thing which perchance lay before her.</p>

<p class="indent">Lining the panelled walls, which were painted a
deep yellow tint, hung a series of curious old colour-prints
of London, and, on the writing-table&mdash;itself, as
Katty's quick eyes had at once realised, a singularly
fine piece of eighteenth-century English lacquer&mdash;were
two portraits. The one was a miniature of a
lady in the stiff yet becoming costume of early Victorian
days&mdash;probably Lord St. Amant's mother; and
the other was a spirited sketch of a girl in an old-fashioned
riding habit&mdash;certainly Mrs. Tropenell
forty years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty had remained standing, and soon she wandered
over to the open door of the room where, with
noiseless celerity, the table was being laid for luncheon.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
It was from there that she almost imperceptibly
beckoned to her host. With some prejudice and a
good deal of curiosity, he followed her, and together
they went over to the deep embrasured window overlooking
the tiny square.</p>

<p class="indent">There, looking up earnestly into Lord St. Amant's
shrewd, kindly face, she said in a low voice: "I
want to ask you, Lord St. Amant, to do me a kindness&mdash;"
she waited a moment, "a true kindness! I
want you to arrange that I go to this place, to Duke
House, with whoever goes there to find out if the
news contained in that horrible letter is true!"</p>

<p class="indent">And as he looked extremely surprised, she hurried
on, with a little catch in her voice, "Godfrey Pavely
was my dear&mdash;my very dear, friend. When we were
quite young people, when I was living with my father
in Pewsbury&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I remember your father," said Lord St. Amant,
in a softened, kindly tone, and his mind suddenly
evoked the personality of the broken-down, not very
reputable gentleman to whom the surrounding gentry
had taken pains to be kind.</p>

<p class="indent">"In those days," went on Katty rather breathlessly,
"Godfrey and I fell in love and became engaged.
But his people were furious, and as a result&mdash;well,
he was made to go to Paris for a year, and the whole
thing came to an end. Later, after I had divorced
my husband, when I was living at Rosedean, it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped, and tears&mdash;the first tears she had shed
this terrible morning&mdash;came into her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"I quite understand&mdash;you mean that it all began
again?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
Lord St. Amant, hardened man of the world though
he was, felt moved, really moved by those hurried,
whispered confidences, and by the bright tears which
were now welling up in his guest's brown eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty nodded. "He was unhappy with Laura&mdash;Laura
had never cared for him, and lately she,
Laura&mdash;&mdash;" Again she broke off what she was saying,
and reddened deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?" said Lord St. Amant interrogatively. He
felt suddenly on his guard. Was Mrs. Winslow going
to bring in Oliver Tropenell? But her next words
at once relieved and excessively surprised him.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know all about the Beath affair?"</p>

<p class="indent">And it was his turn to nod gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there was something of the same kind
thought of&mdash;between Godfrey and myself. If&mdash;if
Laura could have been brought to consent, then I
think I may say, Lord St. Amant, that Godfrey hoped,
that I hoped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Once more she broke off short, only to begin again
a moment later: "But I want you to understand&mdash;please,
<i>please</i> believe me&mdash;that neither he nor I was
treacherous to Laura. You can't be treacherous to a
person who doesn't care, can you? I've only told
you all this to show you that I have a right to want
to know whether Godfrey is alive or&mdash;or dead."</p>

<p class="indent">And then Lord St. Amant asked a question that
rather startled Katty&mdash;and put her, in her turn, on
her guard. He glanced down at the letter, that extraordinary
typewritten letter, which Laura had
handed to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you any reason to suppose that Godfrey
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
Pavely was really associated in business with this
mysterious man?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking down into her upturned face he saw a
queer little quiver wave across her mouth, that most
revealing feature of the face. But she eluded the
question. "I did not know much of Godfrey's business
interests. He was always very secret about such
things."</p>

<p class="indent">"She certainly knows there is such a man as Fernando
Apra!" he said to himself, but aloud he observed
kindly: "I presume Mr. Pavely wrote to you
during the early days of his stay in London?"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty hesitated. "Yes," she said at last, "I did
have a letter from him. But it was only about some
business he was doing for me. I was not at Rosedean,
Lord St. Amant. I was away on a visit&mdash;on
two visits."</p>

<p class="indent">And then Katty flushed&mdash;flushed very deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">He quickly withdrew his gaze from her now downcast
face, and&mdash;came to a quite wrong conclusion.
"I see," he said lightly, "you were away yourself, and
probably moving about?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;yes, I was," she eagerly agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">She was feeling a little more comfortable now.
Katty knew the great value of truth, though she sometimes,
nay generally, behaved as if truth were of no
value at all.</p>

<p class="indent">In a sense Lord St. Amant had known Katty from
her childhood&mdash;known her, that is, in the way in
which the great magnate of a country neighbourhood,
if a friendly, human kind of individual, knows every
man, woman and child within a certain radius of his
home. He was of course well aware of Mrs. Tropenell's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
prejudice against Katty, and, without exactly
sharing it, he did not look at her with the kindly,
indulgent eyes with which most members of his sex
regarded the pretty, unfortunate, innocent <i>divorce</i>,
to whom Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Pavely had been so
truly kind.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, as the upshot of Katty's murmured confidences,
her present host certainly acquired a new
interest in, and a new sympathy for, Mrs. Winslow.
Of course she had not deceived him as completely
as she believed herself to have done, for he felt certain
that she knew more of Godfrey Pavely's movements,
during the early days of his stay in London
a fortnight ago, than she admitted. He was also quite
convinced that they had met secretly during their
joint absence from home.</p>

<p class="indent">But Lord St. Amant would have felt a hypocrite
indeed had he on that account thought any the worse
of Katty Winslow. He told himself that after all
the poor little woman did not owe him <i>all</i> the truth!
If Godfrey Pavely had indeed come to his death in
this extraordinary, accidental way, then Katty, whatever
Mrs. Tropenell might feel, was much to be pitied;
nice women, even so broad-minded a woman as was
his own, close friend, are apt to be hard on a woman
who is not perhaps quite&mdash;nice!</p>

<p class="indent">It was therefore with a good deal of curiosity that
he watched his two guests while they ate the luncheon
prepared for them.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura practically took nothing at all. She tried
to swallow a little of the delicious, perfectly cooked
cold chicken and mousse-au-jambon, but in the end
she only managed to drink the whole of the large
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;230]</span>
glass of water her host poured out for her. Katty,
on the other hand, made a good meal, and took her
full share of a half-bottle of champagne. As a result
she looked, when luncheon was over, more like her
usual, pretty, alert self than she had looked yet.
Laura grew paler and paler, and at last Lord St.
Amant, with kindly authority, insisted on her taking
a cup of coffee, and a tiny liqueur glassful of brandy
poured into it French fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm afraid," he said feelingly, "that you have a
very painful ordeal in front of you, my dear. You
won't make it any better by going without food."</p>

<p class="indent">But she gazed at him as if she had not understood
the purport of his words.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;231]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="cap">SIR ANGUS KINROSS, Chief Commissioner of
Police, stood gazing down, with a look of frowning
perplexity, at the sheet of typewritten paper he
held in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">For what seemed a very long time to the other
three people now present in the big light room overlooking
the Embankment, he remained silent. But at
last he exclaimed, "I think it very probable that this
is a hoax&mdash;a stupid, cruel hoax!" And, as no one
spoke, he added slowly, "Whether it be so or not
can soon be ascertained."</p>

<p class="indent">He saw a look of almost convulsive relief flash over
Laura Pavely's face. It was Laura who attracted Sir
Angus in the little group of people which now stood
before him. He knew that it was this beautiful,
tragic-looking young woman who had insisted, against
his strongly expressed wish and judgment, on offering
the reward which had already brought a swarm
of semi-lunatics and adventurers into the case. As
for the other woman there, he only looked upon her
as a friend of Mrs. Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">Ladies in the painful position of Mrs. Pavely generally
bring a sister, or a close female friend, with
them to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus was keenly interested in this business
of the country banker's disappearance, more interested
than he had been in any other matter of the
kind for a long time. He had all the threads of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
affair very clearly set out in his shrewd, powerful
mind, and only that morning he had learnt something
which he believed none of the three people now standing
before him&mdash;Mrs. Pavely, Mrs. Winslow, and
Lord St. Amant&mdash;knew, or were likely ever to know,
except, of course, if certain eventualities made the
fact important.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus had just learnt that Godfrey Pavely had
spent some hours of a day he had passed at York in
the company of a woman, and both he and the very
able man he had put in charge of the case, had made
up their minds that here, at last, was the real clue
to the banker's disappearance. Godfrey Pavely, so
they argued at "The Yard," was certainly alive, and
either on the Continent, or hidden snugly in some
English or Scottish country town&mdash;not alone.</p>

<p class="indent">As so often happens, the fact that Mr. Pavely had
been in York with a lady had come to light in a very
simple way. When the fact of the well-known country
banker's disappearance had been announced in
the Press, the manager of the Yorkshire branch of
a London bank had written to Scotland Yard, and
stated that on a certain afternoon about a fortnight
ago&mdash;he could not remember the exact day, unfortunately&mdash;he
had seen Mr. Godfrey Pavely, of Pewsbury,
in the company of a lady whom he, the bank
manager, had naturally supposed to be Mrs. Pavely.
He had looked at the banker with a good deal of
interest, owing to the fact that he and Mr. Pavely
had for a while worked in the same bank in Paris
about fifteen years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not met the couple face to face, he had
seen them pass by from the window of his private
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;233]</span>
room at the bank. He could swear to Mr. Pavely,
but he had not paid any special attention to the lady&mdash;for
one thing, she had had her veil down, and he,
feeling sure that she was Mrs. Pavely, had not
troubled to observe her very particularly.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus had sent some one down to York to
see this gentleman, but nothing of further value had
been elicited, excepting, yes, that the lady had struck
him as being young and attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was that the extraordinary typewritten letter
received by Mrs. Pavely that morning very much
upset the calculations and the theories of Sir Angus
and of his staff.</p>

<p class="indent">With frowning brow he sat down at his table and
touched the electric bell which lay concealed close
to his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ask Mr. Dowden to come to me," and a minute
later Mr. Dowden came in.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to know anything you can tell me about
Duke House, if indeed there is such a place as Duke
House in Piccadilly. I can't remember the name."</p>

<p class="indent">But at once the other answered: "It's that big new
building they've erected on the site of St. Andrews
House. It fell in to the Crown on the death of the
Duke of St. Andrews, and an American syndicate
bought the site. Duke House, as they call it, was
only opened last October. The lower storeys are
big bachelor flats, and the top half of the building
contains offices. Mr. Biddle, the American millionaire,
has taken the first floor, but he hasn't settled in
yet, and I don't think any of the offices have been
let at all. They are asking very big rents, and they
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span>
are justified, as it's one of the finest sites in the
West End."</p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to get through to the porter of Duke
House. Find out for me whether they have got an
office let to a man&mdash;a Portuguese merchant I take
him to be, of the name of Fernando Apra." He spelt
out the name. "If you have any difficulty in getting
the information, just go up there yourself in a taxi,
and find out. But I'd like you to go back into your
own rooms and try by telephone first."</p>

<p class="indent">There followed a long, painful ten minutes, during
which Sir Angus, though as a rule he was a man of
few words, tried to while away the time by explaining
to the three people who were there why he thought
it unlikely that the letter was genuine.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'd be amazed," he said, "to know the number
of letters we receive purporting to contain important
information which turn out to be false in every particular.
There must be a whole breed of individuals
who spend their time in writing annoying, futile letters,
which, even if signed, are very seldom signed
by the writer's real name. Some of those people are
actuated by vulgar, stupid spite; others are hypnotised
by the thought of a reward. And then, again, such
letters are often written by people who have a grudge
against the police, or, even more often, by some one
who has a grudge against some ordinary person who
has, maybe, done them a bad turn, or to whom they
have done a bad turn! In the last few days we've
had innumerable letters, from all over the kingdom,
concerning Mr. Pavely's disappearance. It is just
possible that this man"&mdash;he looked down again at
the sheet of typewritten paper&mdash;"has an office in Duke
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
House, but I think it very unlikely that Mr. Godfrey
Pavely was even acquainted with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir, the party in question has got an office
there right enough, but he hasn't been at Duke House
for some time&mdash;some three weeks, the porter said. He
took the office late in October, and for a time he was
there, on and off, a good deal. The porter don't
quite know what his business is, but as far as he
knows he gives him a good character. His office is
right at the very top of the house, the only one let
on that floor."</p>

<p class="indent">An unpleasant little trickle of doubt came over Sir
Angus's mind. When he had first read the typewritten
letter, he had doubted very much if there was
such a building in existence as Duke House, Piccadilly.
Then, after he had heard that the place was
there, after, as a matter of fact, it had been recalled
to his memory by his subordinate, he had fallen back
on the belief that there would be no person of the
name of Fernando Apra to be found in Duke House.</p>

<p class="indent">He now fell back on a third position. Doubtless
this extraordinary letter had been written by some
enemy of the man Apra who wished to cause him the
unpleasantness of a visit from the police.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few moments' thought Sir Angus Kinross
proposed something which none of the three people
there knew to be a most surprising departure from his
usual rule.</p>

<p class="indent">"What would you say, Lord St. Amant, if you and
I were to go up there now, to Duke House&mdash;accompanied,
of course, by two of my men? That, at any
rate, would put an end to Mrs. Pavely's suspense.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
If she doesn't mind doing so, Mrs. Pavely and her
friend can wait here, in my private room."</p>

<p class="indent">To Lord St. Amant the proposal seemed a most
natural one. "I think that's a very good idea!" he
exclaimed, and then he saw Katty's eyes fixed imploringly
on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Why, of course&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent">He beckoned to Sir Angus, and the two men walked
over to the big window overlooking the Embankment.
"If it would not be greatly out of order," he muttered,
"I think it might be a good thing if Mrs. Winslow&mdash;that
is Mrs. Pavely's friend&mdash;were to go with
us to Duke House. She might be useful&mdash;she has
known Mr. Godfrey Pavely all her life."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus looked very much surprised. "Of course
she could come," he said hesitatingly. "Mrs. Winslow?
I didn't realise that this lady is Mrs. Winslow.
Didn't I see a letter written to her by Mr. Godfrey
Pavely? She has some odd Christian name&mdash;if it's
the person I have in my mind."</p>

<p class="indent">"Her Christian name is Katty," said Lord St.
Amant quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, that was it&mdash;'My dear Katty.' I remember
now. It was a letter about an investment, written
on the 30th of December, if I'm not mistaken. Certainly
she can come with us. I have my car downstairs&mdash;she
could drive in my car, and wait in it
while we make the investigation."</p>

<p class="indent">The two came back to where the ladies were sitting,
silently waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have suggested to Sir Angus that it might be
useful if Mrs. Winslow came with us&mdash;and you too,
my dear Laura, if you desire to do so, of course."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span>
But Laura shook her head, and an expression of
horror came into her face. "Oh no," she exclaimed.
"I would much rather stay here!"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty had already got up, and was drawing on the
gloves she had taken off. She felt strung up, fearfully
excited&mdash;and very, very grateful to Lord St.
Amant.</p>

<p class="indent">She was quite unaware that for the first time the
Commissioner of Police was looking at her with attention.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">There were two entrances to Duke House, the one
giving access to the four spacious flats, of which so
far only one had been let, while the other simply
consisted of a porter's lodge and a lift shooting
straight up to the offices which were above the flats.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, within ten minutes of their leaving Scotland
Yard, they were all standing just within the
second door, filling up the small space in front of
the lift, for Mrs. Winslow at the last moment had
begged to be allowed to get out of the car. "I don't
feel as if I <i>could</i> sit there&mdash;waiting," she had exclaimed,
and after a moment's hesitation Sir Angus
allowed the plea.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant noticed with interest that the Police
Commissioner took no part in the preliminary
proceedings. He left everything to the elder of the
two men he had brought with him. Still, he lent a
very attentive ear to what his subordinate was saying
to the porter, and to the porter's answers.</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect that it was you who answered the telephone
message I sent half an hour ago, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, of course I did&mdash;you mean about Mr. Apra
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
here? Well, I told you then everything there is to
say about him. He's a foreigner, of course&mdash;but a
very pleasant-mannered gentleman. He took an office
on the second day we was open. For a while he was
here a good bit most days, and quite a number of
people came to see him on business. Then he went
abroad, I fancy I heard him say, and his office was
shut up. He wouldn't let any one go in, not even
to clean it, unless he was there. He explained as
how his business was very secret&mdash;something to do
with a Concession. He was nervous lest other folk
should get hold of the idea."</p>

<p class="indent">"When was he here last?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it's difficult for me to remember such a
thing as that&mdash;I can't be sure that I could say he
was here within the last fortnight, or perhaps ten
days ago. Two or three people have called to see
him. One gentleman came by appointment&mdash;I do remember
that, because he'd been several times, and
mostly this Mr. Apra was in to see him. But I don't
see what call you have to ask me all these questions?"</p>

<p class="indent">The Scotland Yard man bent forward and said
something in a low voice, and the porter exclaimed,
with an air of astonishment, "What? You don't
mean to say the gentleman's 'wanted'?"</p>

<p class="indent">Then the detective said something else in a joking
way, and the porter shook his head. "I haven't got
a key! He had another lock put on. Lots of business
gentlemen do that." And then he asked anxiously,
"D'you see any objection to my telephoning to
Messrs. Drew &amp; Co.&mdash;they're the agents, you know?
'Twould make me more comfortable in my own mind,
because then I shouldn't get blamed&mdash;whatever happened.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
They'd send some one along in about five
minutes&mdash;they've got a West End office."</p>

<p class="indent">The Scotland Yard official looked round for instructions
from Sir Angus, and the latter imperceptibly
nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right&mdash;we'll wait five minutes. I've brought
some tools along."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tools?" The porter stared at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sometimes, you know, we do find it necessary to
burst open a door!"</p>

<p class="indent">The five minutes&mdash;it was barely more&mdash;seemed the
longest time Katty had ever spent in waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant took pity on her obvious unease
and anxiety. He walked out with her to the street,
and they paced quickly up and down in the cold, wintry
air.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think we shall find anything?" she murmured
at last.</p>

<p class="indent">He answered gravely, "I confess that the whole
thing looks very queer to me. I haven't lived to my
time of life without becoming aware that amazing,
astounding things <i>do</i> happen. Perhaps I am over-influenced
by the fact that years and years ago, when
I was a boy, a school-fellow of mine, of whom I was
very fond, did shoot himself accidentally with a pistol.
He was staying with us, and he had gone on in
front of me into the gun-room&mdash;and I&mdash;I went in
and found him lying on the ground&mdash;dead."</p>

<p class="indent">"How horrible!" murmured Katty. "How very
horrible!" and her face blanched.</p>

<p class="indent">As they turned yet once more, a taxi drove quickly
up to the door of Duke Mansion, and a young, clean-shaven
man jumped out.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
Instinctively he addressed himself to Sir Angus
Kinross: "About this tenant of ours&mdash;Mr. Fernando
Apra? To the best of my belief he is a perfectly respectable
man. He gave a very good reference, that
of a big Paris banker, and with us, at any rate, he
was quite frank about his business. He has obtained
a gambling concession from this new Portuguese Government,
and he came to London to try and raise
money for the building of a Casino, and so on. He's
an optimistic chap, and his notion is to create a kind of
Portuguese Monte Carlo. He told us quite frankly
that he didn't intend to keep the office going here for
more than six months, or possibly a year, and we arranged
that he should be able to surrender his three
years' lease&mdash;we don't let these rooms under a three
years' agreement&mdash;on the payment of a rather substantial
fine. I think the porter is sure to have a key
which will admit you into his room&mdash;I understand you
want to get into his office?"</p>

<p class="indent">And then, at last, Sir Angus answered, rather drily,
"The porter cannot admit us to the office, for this
Mr. Fernando Apra has had a second lock fitted. It
seems he never allowed any one access to the room&mdash;unless
he happened to be there himself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he had plans there&mdash;plans of this Concession,
and he was very secretive, as are so many foreigners.
Still, he impressed both me and my father more
favourably than do most foreigners we come across.
As a matter of fact, we twice lunched with him at the
Berkeley. He is a man with a tremendous flow of
good spirits&mdash;speaking English very well, though of
course with a foreign accent. Has he got into any
trouble?" he looked curiously at the gentleman standing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
before him. He was not aware of Sir Angus Kinross's
identity, but he knew that he was from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall know more about that when we have
forced open the door of his office. I presume you
would like to be present?"</p>

<p class="indent">And the young man nodded. A grave, uneasy
expression came over his face; he wondered if he
had said too much of his pleasant client, and that
client's private affairs."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="cap">THEY went up the lift in two parties: Sir Angus
Kinross, the house agent, and the two men from
Scotland Yard; then Lord St. Amant and Katty Winslow
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">As they were going up, he said kindly, "Are you
sure you are wise in doing this? I fear&mdash;I fear the
worst, Mrs. Winslow!"</p>

<p class="indent">With dry lips she muttered, "Yes, so do I. But I
would rather come all the same. I'll wait outside the
door."</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Katty! She was telling herself that it was
surely impossible&mdash;<i>impossible</i> that Godfrey Pavely
should be dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Though his vitality had always been low, he had
been intensely individual. His self-importance, his
egoism, his lack of interest in anything but himself,
Katty, and the little world where he played so important
a part&mdash;all that had made him a forceful personality,
especially to this woman who had possessed
whatever he had had of heart and passionate feeling.
She had felt of late as if he were indeed part of the
warp and woof of her life, and deep in her scheming
mind had grown a kind of superstitious belief that
sooner or later their lives would become one.</p>

<p class="indent">The thought that he might be lying dead in this
great new building filled her with a sort of sick horror.
There seemed something at once so futile and so
hideously cruel about so stupid an accident as that described
in the Portuguese financier's letter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;243]</span>
They stepped out on to a top landing, from which
branched off several narrow corridors. The agent led
the way down one of these. "Room No. 18? This
must be it&mdash;this <i>is</i> it! Look, there are the two keyholes!"</p>

<p class="indent">The younger and the brawnier of the two plainclothes
detectives came forward. "If you'll just stand
aside, gentlemen, for a minute or two, we'll soon get
this door open. It's quite an easy matter."</p>

<p class="indent">He opened his unobtrusive-looking, comparatively
small bag. There was a sound of wrenching wood
and metal, and then the door swung backwards into
the room together with a thick green velvet curtain
fixed along the top of the door on a hinged rod.</p>

<p class="indent">A flood of wintry sunshine, thrown by the blinking
now setting sun of a London January afternoon,
streamed into the dark passage, and Sir Angus Kinross
strode forward into the room, Lord St. Amant immediately
behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty shrank back and then placed herself by the
wall of the passage. She put her hand over her eyes,
as if to shut out a dreadful sight, yet all there was to
see was an open door through which came a shaft of
pallid wintry afternoon light.</p>

<p class="indent">For a space of perhaps thirty seconds, Sir Angus's
trained eyes and mind took in what he supposed to be
every detail of the oblong room overlooking the now
bare tree tops of the Green Park. He noted that the
office furniture was extremely good&mdash;first-rate of its
kind. Also that the most prominent thing in the room
was an American roll-top desk of an exceptionally
large size.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;244]</span>
Placed at right angles right across the office, this
desk concealed nearly half the room.</p>

<p class="indent">In the corner behind the door was a coat stand, on
which there hung a heavy, fur-lined coat, and a silk
hat. On the floor was a thick carpet. The only unbroken
space of wall was covered by a huge diagram
map of what looked like a piece of sea shore.</p>

<p class="indent">One peculiar fact also attracted the attention of the
Commissioner of Police. Both the windows overlooking
the Park were wide open, fixed securely back as
far as they would go: and on the window seats, comfortably,
nay luxuriously, padded, and upholstered in
green velvet, there now lay a thick layer of grime, the
effect of the fog and rain of the last fortnight. As
they stood within the door, in spite of those widely
opened windows, there gradually stole on the senses
of the four men there, a very curious odour, an
odour which struck each of them as horribly significant.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another thing Sir Angus noted in that quick, initial
glance; this was that the blind of the narrow window
which gave on to the street side of Duke House
was drawn down, casting one half of the room in deep
shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned, and addressing Lord St. Amant in a very
low voice, almost in a whisper, he said: "I think we
shall find what we have come to seek over there, behind
that desk."</p>

<p class="indent">Walking forward, he edged round by the side of the
big piece of walnut wood furniture.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he started back, and exclaimed under his
breath, "Good God! How horrible!"</p>

<p class="indent">He had thought to see a body lying at full length
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;245]</span>
on the carpet, but what he did see, sitting upright at
the desk, was a stark, immobile figure, of which the
head, partly blown away, was sunk forward on the
breast....</p>

<p class="indent">Great care had been taken to wedge the dead man
securely back in the arm-chair, and a cursory glance,
in the dim light in which that part of the room was
cast, would have given an impression of sleep, not of
death.</p>

<p class="indent">He beckoned to Lord St. Amant. "Come over here,"
he whispered, "you needn't go any nearer. Do you
recognise that as being the body of Godfrey Pavely?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Lord St. Amant, hastening forward, stared
with a mixture of curiosity and horror at the still
figure, and answered, "Yes. I&mdash;I think there's no
doubt about it's being Pavely."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps you'd better go and tell Mrs. Winslow.
Get her away as quick as you can. I must telephone
at once for one of our doctors."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant turned without a word, and made
his way through the still open door into the queer,
rather dark passage.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty's face was still full of the strain and anguish
of suspense, but she knew the truth by now. Had
nothing been found, some one would have come rushing
out at once to tell her so. Three or four minutes had
elapsed since she had heard the sudden hush, the ominous
silence, which had fallen over them all, in there.</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips formed the words: "Then&mdash;they've found
him?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Lord St. Amant nodded gravely. "It looks as
if that Portuguese chap had told the simple truth."</p>

<p class="indent">"The moment that I read the letter this morning I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span>
<i>knew</i> that it was true," she muttered. Then, "I suppose
I'd better go away now? They don't want me
here."</p>

<p class="indent">She began walking towards the lift, and Lord St.
Amant, following, felt very sorry for her. "Look
here," he said earnestly, "I'm sure you don't wish to
go straight back to poor Laura Pavely? Why should
you? 'Twould only rack you. I suppose&mdash;&mdash;" He
stopped a moment, and she looked up at him questioningly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Lord St. Amant&mdash;what is it you suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty spoke in a cold, hard voice&mdash;all her small affectations
had fallen away from her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose," he said, "that Laura knew very little
of your friendship with poor Godfrey Pavely?"</p>

<p class="indent">And she answered, again in that hard, cold voice,
"Yes, Laura did know, I think, almost everything there
was to know. She didn't care&mdash;she didn't mind.
Laura has no feeling."</p>

<p class="indent">As he made no reply to that, she went on, rather
breathlessly, and with sudden passion, "You think that
I'm unfair&mdash;you think that Laura really cares because
she looked so shocked and miserable this morning?
But that's just what she was&mdash;<i>shocked</i>, nothing else.
What is a piece of terrible, <i>terrible</i> bad luck for me, is
good&mdash;very good luck for Laura!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was such concentrated bitterness in her tone
that Lord St. Amant felt repelled&mdash;repelled as well as
sorry.</p>

<p class="indent">But all he said was: "Would you like to go back to
my rooms for an hour or two? They're quite near
here."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I'd rather face Laura now, at once. After all,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;247]</span>
I shall have to see her some time. I'm bound to be her
nearest neighbour for a while, at any rate."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Late that same night the awful news was broken
to Mrs. Tropenell by her son. He had sent a message
saying he would be down by the last train, and she
had sat up for him, knowing nothing, yet aware that
something had happened that morning which had sent
Laura and Katty hurrying up to town.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps because the news he told was so unexpected,
so strange, and to them both of such vital moment,
the few minutes which followed Oliver's return remained
stamped, as if branded with white hot iron,
on the tablets of Mrs. Tropenell's memory.</p>

<p class="indent">When she heard his firm, hurried footsteps outside,
she ran to let him in, and at once, as he came into the
house, he said in a harsh, cold voice: "Godfrey
Pavely is dead, mother. A foreigner with whom he
had entered into business relations shot him by accident.
The man wrote to Laura a confession of what
he had done. She got the letter this morning, took it
up to London to the police&mdash;the best thing she could
do&mdash;and Pavely's body was found at the place indicated,
a business office."</p>

<p class="indent">As Oliver spoke, in quick, jerky sentences, he was
taking off his greatcoat, and hanging up his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">She waited till he had done, and then only said:
"I've got a little supper ready for you, darling. I sent
the servants off to bed, so I'm alone downstairs."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver sighed, a long, tired sigh of relief&mdash;relief that
his mother had asked no tiresome, supplementary questions.
And she saw the look of strain, and of desperate
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;248]</span>
fatigue, smooth itself away, as he followed her into
their peaceful dining-room.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat with him, and so far commanded her nerves
as to remain silent while he ate with a kind of hungry
eagerness which astonished her.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to her at last, and for the first time smiled
a rather wry smile. "I was very hungry! This is
my first meal to-day, and I seem to have lived in the
train. I was up at York&mdash;we thought there was a clue
there. I think I told you that over the telephone?
Then I came back."</p>

<p class="indent">She broke in gently, "To be met with this awful
news, Oliver?"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her rather strangely, and nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you seen Laura?" she ventured.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, just for a moment. But, mother? She's horribly
unhappy. I&mdash;I expected her to be glad."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a tone of horror, more, of reprobation, in
Mrs. Tropenell's low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell was staring straight before him.
"Surely one would have expected her to be glad that
the suspense was over? And now I ask myself&mdash;&mdash;"
and indeed he looked as if he was speaking to himself
and not to her&mdash;"if it would have been better for
Laura if that&mdash;that fellow had been left to rot there
till he had been discovered, two months, three months,
perchance four months hence."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear," she said painfully, "what do you mean
exactly? I don't understand."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pavely's body was found in an empty office, and
if the man who shot him hadn't written to Laura&mdash;well,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;249]</span>
of course the body would have remained there
till it had occurred to some one to force open the door
of the room, and that might not have happened for
months."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm very glad that Laura was told now," said Mrs.
Tropenell firmly. "The suspense was telling on her
far more than I should have expected it to do. Katty,
too, became a very difficult element in the situation. I
don't think there's much doubt that poor Katty was
very fond of Godfrey."</p>

<p class="indent">He muttered: "Mean little loves, mean little lives,
mean little souls&mdash;they were well matched!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then he got up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, mother, I must be off to bed now, as I have
to get up early and go into Pewsbury. Laura, who's
staying on in town, asked me to come down and tell
those whom it concerned, the truth. She wants you
to tell Alice. I said I thought you'd have the child here
for a while."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly I will. She's been here all to-day, poor
little girl."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you really think she's to be pitied, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated, but his stern face compelled an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't think that Godfrey would have got on with
Alice later on&mdash;when she grew to woman's estate.
But now, yes, I do think the child's to be deeply pitied.
It will be a painful, a terrible memory&mdash;that her father
died like that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can't see it! A quiet, merciful death, mother&mdash;one
that many a man might envy." He waited a few
moments, then went on: "Of course there will be an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
inquest, and I fear Laura will almost certainly have to
give evidence, in order to prove the receipt of that&mdash;that
peculiar letter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you got a copy of the letter?" asked Mrs.
Tropenell rather eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">Her son shook his head. "No, the police took possession
of it. But I've seen it of course."</p>

<p class="indent">They were both standing up now. He went to the
door, and held it open for her. And then, with his
eyes bent on her face, he asked her a question which
perhaps was not as strange as it sounded, between
those two who were so much to one another, and who
thought they understood each other so well.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother," he said slowly, "I want to ask you a
question.... How long in England does an unloving
widow mourn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A decent woman, under normal conditions, mourns
at least a year," she answered, and a little colour came
into her face. Then, out of her great love for him,
she forced herself to add, "But that does not bar out a
measure of friendship, Oliver. Give Laura time to
become accustomed to the new conditions of her life."</p>

<p class="indent">"How long, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Give her till next Christmas, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"I will."</p>

<p class="indent">He put his arms round her. "Mother!" he exclaimed,
"I love you the better for my loving Laura. Do you
realise that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I will believe it if you tell me so, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">He strode off, hastened up the staircase without
looking round again, and she, waiting below, covered
her face with her hands. A terrible sense of loneliness
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
swept over and engulfed her; for the first time there
was added a pang of regret that she had not joined
her life to that of the affectionate hedonist who had
been her true, devoted friend for so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="cap">AND so, in this at once amazing and simple way
was solved the mystery of Godfrey Pavely's disappearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Inquiries made by the police soon elicited the fact
that the Portuguese financier had told the truth as
regarded his business in England, for a considerable
number of persons voluntarily came forward to confirm
the account the man had given of himself in his
strange letter.</p>

<p class="indent">During his sojourn at the Mayfair Hotel, the now
mysterious Fernando Apra had impressed those who
came in contact with him pleasantly rather than otherwise.
It was also remembered there that one morning,
about three weeks ago, he had come in looking agitated
and distressed, and that he had confided to the manager
of the hotel that an accident of a very extraordinary
nature had occurred to him. But there his confidences
had stopped&mdash;he had not said what it was that had
happened to him. A day or two later, he had gone
away, explaining that his business in England was concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura stayed up in town till the inquest, and so,
rather to Laura's surprise, did Katty Winslow.</p>

<p class="indent">As is always the case when there is anything of
the nature of a mystery, the inquest was largely attended
by the ordinary public. But no sensational evidence
was tendered, though person after person went
into the witness-box to prove that they had come in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span>
contact with Fernando Apra, and that under a seal of
secrecy he had informed them of his gambling concession
and of the scheme for developing what he believed
would be a hugely profitable undertaking. In fact, he
had spoken to more than one man of business of a
possible two hundred per cent. profit.</p>

<p class="indent">It also became clear, for the first time, why Mr.
Pavely had gone to York. A gentleman who bore the
aristocratic name of Greville Howard, and who was in
too poor a state of health to come up to the inquest,
volunteered the information that Fernando Apra had
come to see him, Greville Howard, with an introduction
from Mr. Godfrey Pavely. Further, that he,
Mr. Howard, having gone into the matter of the proposed
gambling concession, had suggested that the
three should meet and have a chat over the business.
As a result, a rather odd thing had happened. Mr.
Apra did not accept the invitation, but Mr. Pavely,
whom he had known for some years, had come to see
him, and they had discussed the project. Then he,
Greville Howard, had heard nothing more till he had
seen in a daily paper a casual allusion to the fact of
Mr. Godfrey Pavely's disappearance!</p>

<p class="indent">But, though so much was cleared up, two rather
important questions remained unanswered. There was
no proof, through any of the shipping companies, that
Fernando Apra had left England under his own name.
Also, while there were apparently several men of that
same rather common name in Lisbon, the Portuguese
police seemed unable to give any clue as to this particular
man's identity. But a plausible explanation of this
was to be found in the fact that Portugal had lately
changed her form of government.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
Though the mystery was now in no sense any longer
a mystery, a rather peculiar verdict was returned.
The foreman of the jury, a tiresome, self-opinionated
man, declared that he and his fellow jurymen were not
really satisfied as to how Godfrey Pavely had come
by his death, and they added a strong rider to their
verdict, expressing an earnest hope that every effort
would be made to find Fernando Apra.</p>

<p class="indent">The inquest lasted two days, and as Laura insisted
on being present the whole time, the ordeal for her
was severe. She was, however, supported by the companionship
and presence of Mrs. Tropenell, who had
come up on purpose to be with her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After having put Mrs. Tropenell and Laura in a carriage,
Lord St. Amant and Sir Angus Kinross walked
away from the building where the inquest had been
held. For a while neither man said anything.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, Lord St. Amant exclaimed: "I
don't know what <i>you</i> think about it, but in spite of all
we have heard, I can't help having a suspicion that
that man Fernando Apra's story is a bit too thin. I
take it that he and Pavely may have had a quarrel&mdash;it's
even possible that this Portuguese fellow may have
wanted to get Pavely out of this exceedingly profitable
business. But no man, least of all a man accustomed
to carrying firearms, would play about with a pistol
quite close to the back of another man's head!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I've known stranger things than that happen,"
said Sir Angus slowly. "But in any case this Portuguese
fellow is an uncommonly clever chap. He's
clean covered up his tracks."</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated a moment&mdash;and then added "I can tell
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;255]</span>
you one queer thing, St. Amant. This man Pavely's
pockets were very thoroughly gone through by whoever
shot him. One side of his coat had the lining
ripped open."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yet quite a good bit of money was found on him,"
observed Lord St. Amant.</p>

<p class="indent">"Whoever went through his pockets wasn't looking
for money." Sir Angus spoke significantly.</p>

<p class="indent">He went on: "Though it was implied to-day that
no papers or letters were discovered on the body,
there was, as a matter of fact, an envelope found in
an inner pocket. It was one of those inner pockets
which some men have put into the inner lining of a
waistcoat, the kind of pocket which is practically impossible
to find&mdash;especially if you're in a hurry, and
don't suspect its existence."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant's curiosity was sharply aroused.
He ventured a question: "And the contents of the
envelope?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, between ourselves, the contents of the envelope
astonished me very much. The envelope,
stamped with the name of Pavely's Bank, contained
two rather scurrilous anonymous letters. To me, the
curious thing consisted in the fact that Pavely had
thought it worth while to keep them. I should have
destroyed them at once in his place."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do they throw any light on the mystery?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, of course not, or they would have been produced
in evidence to-day. But still, one never can tell.
Of course we are keeping them." He added significantly,
"They were not letters I should have cared to
hand back to Mr. Pavely's widow."</p>

<p class="indent">And then the Commissioner of Police added something
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;256]</span>
which very much surprised his companion: "By
the way, talking of Mr. Pavely's widow, I do earnestly
beg you to try and dissuade Mrs. Pavely from continuing
that thousand pounds reward."</p>

<p class="indent">"Surely the reward has lapsed now? The only person
entitled to it would be this man, Fernando Apra
himself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, but Mrs. Pavely&mdash;or so Mr. Tropenell tells
me&mdash;is quite determined to keep the offer of the reward
open. Whereas before the discovery of Mr.
Pavely's body the reward was offered for any information
leading to his discovery dead or alive, that
same sum is now to be offered to any one who can
bring us into communication with this Portuguese fellow
himself. I'm bound to say that Mr. Tropenell saw
at once all the inconvenience of such a course, and he
has done his best to dissuade Mrs. Pavely. But she's
quite set on it! I fancy she's been persuaded to go
on with it by Mrs. Winslow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" said Lord St. Amant. "I can't say that that
surprises me. Mrs. Winslow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Then he stopped short, and the other looked quickly
round at him, and exclaimed: "I wish you'd tell me
a little more than I've been able to find out about this
Mrs. Winslow. What exactly was her position in the
Pavely <i>mnage</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant hesitated. He felt bound to stand
up for poor Katty. So, "Only that she and poor Godfrey
Pavely were very old friends&mdash;friends from childhood,"
he answered slowly. "And since the time she
divorced her husband Mrs. Winslow has lived close to
The Chase&mdash;in fact, she was their tenant."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
"Then Mrs. Winslow was Pavely's rather than Mrs.
Pavely's friend?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;if you care to put it that way."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've very little doubt&mdash;in fact I feel quite sure, St.
Amant, that Mrs. Winslow knows a great deal more
about the whole affair than she has chosen to reveal.
When she and I talked the whole thing over, I brought
her to admit that she <i>had</i> heard something of this secret
business arrangement between Pavely and Fernando
Apra. But if she was speaking the truth&mdash;and
I think she was&mdash;there was a reason for her having
been told. She was herself investing a small sum
in the concern."</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil she was!" Lord St. Amant was very
much surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and on Pavely's advice, of course. I take
it that he was on more confidential terms with this
lady than he was with his own wife?"</p>

<p class="indent">The other nodded, reluctantly. "Well, you must
know by this time almost as well as I did that the
Pavelys were not on very&mdash;well, happy terms, together!"</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus went on: "D'you remember something
I told you concerning Mr. Pavely's day at York?
Even before we knew all you have heard to-day, we
felt quite convinced that he'd gone down there to see
the old rascal who calls himself Greville Howard. But
some further information about that journey to York
is in our possession."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant again nodded. There came a
rather uneasy look over his face. He thought he knew
the nature of the further confidence which was about
to be made to him. He had never had any doubt in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
his own mind that Godfrey Pavely had not gone alone
to Yorkshire.</p>

<p class="indent">"We feel quite certain that Mrs. Winslow was with
Pavely in York. He was seen there, in the company
of a lady, by a business acquaintance. We've ascertained
that Mrs. Winslow went, on that same day, to
stay with some rather well-known people in the neighbourhood.
Mind you, I'm not for a moment suggesting
that there was anything wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder," said Lord St. Amant suddenly, "why
Mrs. Winslow still desires the reward to be offered."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I can tell you why."</p>

<p class="indent">The Commissioner of Police looked straight into
the other man's eyes. "Mrs. Winslow wishes this
reward to be offered because she has vague hopes of
earning it herself."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant uttered an exclamation of extreme
astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">The other smiled. "Yes&mdash;queer, isn't it? But, mind
you, that's by no means an uncommon trait in the
type of woman to which Mrs. Winslow belongs. Their
motives are almost always mixed. They're subtle little
devils for the most part, St. Amant. Mrs. Winslow
was quite sufficiently fond of this unfortunate man to
wish to avenge his death, and she also would be very
glad suddenly to receive an addition to her fortune&mdash;which
is, I understand, very small&mdash;of even a thousand
pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">He added, in a graver tone: "It seems to me that
the one chance we have of influencing Mrs. Pavely
is through you. And then again, the mere fact that
you are one of her trustees may make a difference.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
Would you not have it in your power to <i>prevent</i> her
continuing this reward?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant shook his head very decidedly.
"No, I should not feel justified in doing that, even
if I had the power. As a matter of fact, she has a
certain amount of money at her own absolute disposal.
I may tell you that I did my best to dissuade
her from offering the reward when she first made up
her mind to do so&mdash;you will remember when I mean?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">As Lord St. Amant made his way back to his own
rooms, the rooms where he knew Mrs. Tropenell and
Laura Pavely were now waiting for him, his mind
was in a whirl of surprise and conjecture.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty Winslow acting the part of amateur detective?
What an extraordinary notion! Somehow it
was one which would never have crossed his mind.
That, no doubt, was the real reason why she had been
so determined to attend the inquest. But she had
not sat with Mrs. Pavely, Mrs. Tropenell, and himself.
She had chosen a place in a kind of little gallery behind
the jurymen, and by her side, through the whole
proceedings, had sat, with his arms folded, Oliver
Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">Tropenell, since the discovery of Godfrey Pavely's
body, had kept himself very much apart from the
others. He had gone down to Pewsbury, and had
broken the sad news to Mr. Privet&mdash;this by Laura's
direct request and desire. But he had not shown
even the discreet interest Lord St. Amant would have
expected him to show in the newly-made widow and
her affairs, and there was something enigmatic and
reserved in his attitude.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
One thing he had done. He had made a great effort
to prevent Laura Pavely's being put into the witness-box.
He had discovered that she shrank with a
kind of agonised horror from the ordeal, and he had
begged Lord St. Amant to join him in trying to spare
her. But of course their efforts had been of no avail.
Laura, in one sense, was the principal witness. But
for her receipt of the letter, the body of her husband
might not have been discovered for weeks, maybe for
months. Fernando Apra would only have had to send
a further instalment of rent, with the proviso that his
room should not be entered till he returned, for the
mystery to remain a mystery for at any rate a long
time.</p>

<p class="indent">The funeral of Godfrey Pavely was to take place
the next day in the old Parish Church of Pewsbury,
where the Pavely family had a vault. The arrangements
had all been left to Mr. Privet, and the only
time Lord St. Amant had seen Oliver Tropenell smile
since the awful discovery had been made, had been in
this connection.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm very glad we thought of it," he said, "I mean
that Mrs. Pavely and myself thought of it. Poor old
Privet! He was one of the very few people in the
world who was ever really attached to Godfrey Pavely.
And the fact that all the arrangements have been left
to him is a great consolation, not to say pleasure, to
the poor old fellow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="cap">IT was the day of Godfrey Pavely's funeral, and
more than one present at the great gathering observed,
either to themselves or aloud to some trusted
crony or acquaintance, that the banker would certainly
have been much gratified had he seen the high
esteem in which he was held by both the gentle and
simple of the surrounding neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Even Lord St. Amant was a good deal impressed by
the scene. Every blind in the High Street was down&mdash;a
striking mark of respect indeed towards both the
dead banker and his widow. Apart from that fact,
the town looked as if it was in the enjoyment of a
public holiday, but even that was in its way a tribute.
The streets were full of people, and round the entrance
to the churchyard was a huge crowd. As for
the churchyard itself, it was overflowing, and presented
a remarkable rather than a touching scene. Only a few
of the town-folk were still allowed to be buried in the
medival churchyard which lay just off the High
Street, so a funeral actually taking place there was a
very rare event.</p>

<p class="indent">The circumstances of Mr. Pavely's death had been
so strange that the local paper had printed a verbatim
report of the inquest, as well as a very flowery account
of the departed, who had been, it was explained,
so true and so loyal a townsman of Pewsbury. Yet,
even so, there were those present at his funeral who
muttered that Mr. Pavely had met his death just as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;262]</span>
might have been expected, through his love of money.
It was also whispered that the job in which this queer
foreigner had been associated with the banker had not
been of the most reputable kind. This Fernando Apra&mdash;every
one knew his queer name because of the big
reward&mdash;had wanted to raise money for a kind of
glorified gambling hell; that was the long and the
short of it, after all, so much the shrewder folk of
Pewsbury had already found out, reading between
the lines of the evidence offered at the inquest.</p>

<p class="indent">In an official sense the chief mourners were two distant
cousins of Godfrey Pavely&mdash;men with whom he
had quarrelled years ago&mdash;but in a real, intimate sense,
the principal mourners were old Mr. Privet, Lord St.
Amant, who, though he was so fond of travel, never
neglected the duties entailed by his position in the
county, and last but by no means least Mr. Oliver
Tropenell, who, as every one present was well aware,
had during the last few months become the one intimate
friend of the dead man. Among the women
there were several who knew that at this very moment
Mrs. Pavely was being comforted by Mr. Oliver
Tropenell's mother, a lady who stood high in public
esteem, and with whom Mrs. Pavely as a girl, had
spent much of her youth, and from whose house, picturesque
Freshley Manor, she had been married to the
man whom they were now engaged in burying.</p>

<p class="indent">Another person present who aroused even more interest
among the good folk of Pewsbury than either
Lord St. Amant or Oliver Tropenell, was Mrs. Winslow.</p>

<p class="indent">The older townspeople looked at Katty with a good
deal of rather excited sympathy, for they remembered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;263]</span>
the gossip and talk there had been about pretty Katty
Fenton and the dead man, and of how unkind old Mrs.
Pavely, now dead many a year, had shown herself to
the lovely, motherless girl.</p>

<p class="indent">There were even some there who whispered that
poor Godfrey Pavely had again become very fond of
his first love&mdash;and that, too, when they were both
old enough to know better! But these busybodies
were not encouraged to say the little they knew. These
are things&mdash;natural human failings&mdash;which should be
forgotten at a man's funeral.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Winslow did not look unreasonably upset.
There were no tears in her bright brown eyes, and her
black frock, sable plumed hat, and beautiful black
furs, intensified the brilliant pink and white of her
complexion. Indeed, many of the people who gazed
at Katty that day thought they had never seen her
looking so attractive. The world belongs to the living&mdash;not
to the dead, and poor Godfrey Pavely, with
his big, prosperous one-man business, and his almost
uncanny cleverness in the matter of making money,
belonged henceforth very decidedly to the past. So it
was that among the men and women who stared with
eager curiosity and respectful interest at the group of
mourners, several noticed that Mr. Oliver Tropenell
seemed to pay special attention to Mrs. Winslow.</p>

<p class="indent">Once he crossed over, and stood close to her for
a minute or two by the still open grave, and his
dark handsome face showed far more trace of emotion
than did hers.</p>

<p class="indent">After the funeral, Lord St. Amant dropped Mrs.
Winslow at the gate of Rosedean, and, on parting
with Katty, he patted her hand kindly, telling himself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;264]</span>
that she was certainly a very pretty woman. Lord
St. Amant, like most connoisseurs in feminine beauty,
preferred seeing a pretty woman in black.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must try and forget poor Godfrey Pavely,"
he said feelingly.</p>

<p class="indent">He was startled and moved by the intensity with
which she answered him:&mdash;"I wish I could&mdash;but I
can't. I feel all the time as if he was there, close to
me, trying to tell me something! I believe that he was
murdered, Lord St. Amant."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sure you're mistaken. You must never think
that!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, but I do think so. I'm certain of it!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Following the old custom, Godfrey Pavely's will
was to be read after his burial, and Laura had written
to Lord St. Amant asking him if he would be present.</p>

<p class="indent">In the great dining-room of The Chase, a dining-room
still lined with the portraits of Mrs. Tropenell's
ancestors, were two tables, one large long table which
was never used, and a round table in the bow-window.
To-day it was about the big table that there were gathered
the five men and the one woman who were to be
present at the reading of the will. Laura was the one
woman. The men were Godfrey Pavely's lawyer, the
dead man's two cousins&mdash;who had perhaps a faint
hope of legacies, a hope destined to be disappointed,
Oliver Tropenell, present as Laura Pavely's trustee,
and Lord St. Amant, who had been a trustee to her
marriage settlement.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura, in her deep black, looked wan, sad and
tired, but perfectly calm. All the men there, with one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;265]</span>
exception, glanced towards her now and again with
sympathy. The exception was Oliver Tropenell. He
had shut her out, as far as was possible, from his mind,
and he seemed hardly aware of her presence. He
stared straight before him, a look of rather impatient
endurance on his face&mdash;not at all, so argued Lord St.
Amant to himself, the look of a man from whose path
a hitherto impassable obstacle has just been removed.</p>

<p class="indent">Though rather ashamed of letting his mind dwell
on such thoughts at such a time, Lord St. Amant told
himself that Mrs. Tropenell had doubtless been mistaken
as to what she had confided to him on his return
from abroad. Mothers are apt to be jealous where
only sons are concerned, and Letty&mdash;his dear, ardent-natured
friend Letty&mdash;had always been romantic.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant was confirmed in this view by
the fact that that very morning Mrs. Tropenell had
told him that Oliver was going back to Mexico almost
at once. To her mind it confirmed what she believed
to be true. But her old friend and some-time lover
had smiled oddly. Lord St. Amant judged Oliver by
himself&mdash;and he had always been a man of hot-foot decisions.
It was inconceivable to him that any lover
could act in so cold-blooded, careful a fashion as this.
No, no&mdash;if Oliver cared for Laura as his mother believed
he cared, he would not now go off to the other
end of the world, simply to placate public opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">To those who had known the man, Godfrey Pavely's
will contained only one surprise, otherwise it ran
on the most conventional lines. Practically the whole
of his very considerable fortune was left, subject to
Laura's life interest&mdash;an interest which lapsed on
re-marriage&mdash;in trust for his only child.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;266]</span>
The surprise was the banker's substantial legacy to
Mrs. Winslow. That lady was left Rosedean, the
only condition attaching to the legacy being that,
should she ever wish to sell the little property, the
first offer must be made to Alice Pavely's trustees.
Also, rather to the astonishment of some of those
present, it was found that the will had only been made
some two months ago, and the lawyer who read it
out was aware that in some important particulars it
had been modified and changed. In the will made by
Godfrey Pavely immediately after his marriage he
had left his wife sole legatee. After Alice was born
the banker had naturally added a codicil, but he had
still left Laura in a far greater position of responsibility
in regard to the estate than in this, his final will.</p>

<p class="indent">After the will had been read, Lord St. Amant
spent a few moments alone with Laura. He felt he
had a rather disagreeable task before him, and he did
not like disagreeable tasks. Still he faced this one
with characteristic courage.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've been asked by Sir Angus Kinross to undertake
a rather unpleasant duty, my dear Laura&mdash;that
of persuading you to withdraw the reward you are offering
for the discovery of Fernando Apra. He points
out that if Apra's story is true, it might easily mean
that you would simply be giving a present of a thousand
pounds to the person who killed your husband."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura heard him out without interruption. Then
she shook her head. "I feel it is my duty to do it,"
she said in a low voice. "Katty, who was Godfrey's
greatest friend, says he would have wished it&mdash;and I
think she's right. It isn't going to be paid out of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;267]</span>
the estate, you know. <i>I</i> will pay it&mdash;if ever it is
earned."</p>

<p class="indent">She went on painfully. "I am very unhappy, Lord
St. Amant. Godfrey and I were not suited to one another,
but still I feel that I was often needlessly selfish
and unkind."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant began to see why Oliver Tropenell
was going back to Mexico so soon.</p>

<h2>PART THREE</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;271]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="cap">THOSE winter and spring months which followed
the tragic death of Godfrey Pavely were full of
difficult, weary, and oppressive days to his widow
Laura. Her soul had become so used to captivity,
and to being instinctively on the defensive, that she
did not know how to use her freedom&mdash;indeed, she
was afraid of freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">Another kind of woman would have gone away to
the Continent, alone or with her child, taking what
in common parlance is described as a thorough change.
But Laura went on living quietly at The Chase, feeling
in a queer kind of way as if Godfrey still governed her
life, as if she ought to do exactly what Godfrey would
wish her to do, all the more so because in his lifetime
she had not been an obedient or submissive wife.</p>

<p class="indent">As the Commissioner of Police had foretold, the
large reward offered by Mrs. Pavely had brought
in its train a host of tiresome and even degrading
incidents. A man of the name of Apra actually came
from the Continent and tried to make out that <i>he</i> had
been the banker's unwitting murderer! But his story
broke down under a very few minutes' cross-examination
at Scotland Yard. Even so, Laura kept the offer
of the thousand pounds in being. It seemed to be the
only thing that she could still do for Godfrey.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;272]</span>
Though she was outwardly leading the quiet, decorously
peaceful life of a newly-made widow, Laura's
soul was storm-tossed and had lost its bearings. Her
little girl's company, dearly as she loved the child, no
longer seemed to content her. For the first time in her
life, she longed consciously for a friend of her own
age, but with the woman living at her gate, with Katty
Winslow, she became less, rather than more, intimate.</p>

<p class="indent">Also, hidden away in the deepest recess of her heart,
was an unacknowledged pain. She had felt so sure
that Oliver Tropenell would stay on with his mother
through the winter and early spring! But, to her bewildered
surprise, he had left for Mexico almost at
once. He had not even sought a farewell interview
to say good-bye to her alone, and their final good-bye
had taken place in the presence of his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Together he and Mrs. Tropenell had walked over
to The Chase one late afternoon, within less than a
week of Godfrey's funeral, and he had explained that
urgent business was recalling him to Mexico at once.
He and Laura had had, however, three or four minutes
together practically alone; and at once he had exclaimed,
in a voice so charged with emotion that it
recalled those moments Laura now shrank from
remembering&mdash;those moments when he had told her of
his then lawless love&mdash;"You'll let me know if ever
you want me? A cable would bring me as quickly
as I can travel. You must not forget that I am your
trustee."</p>

<p class="indent">And she had replied, making a great effort to speak
naturally: "I will write to you, Oliver, often&mdash;and
I hope you will write to me."</p>

<p class="indent">And he had said: "Yes&mdash;yes, of course I will!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;273]</span>
Not that there's much to say that will interest you.
But I can always give you news of Gillie."</p>

<p class="indent">He had said nothing as to when they were to meet
again. But after he was gone Mrs. Tropenell had
spoken as if he intended to come back the following
Christmas.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver had so far kept his promise that he had
written to Laura about once a fortnight. They were
very ordinary, commonplace letters&mdash;not long, intimate,
and detailed as she knew his letters to his mother
to be. Mostly he wrote of Gillie, and of whatever
work Gillie at the moment was engaged upon.</p>

<p class="indent">On her side, she would write to him of little Alice,
of the child's progress with her lessons, of the funny
little things that Alice said. Occasionally she would
also force herself to put in something about Godfrey,
generally on some matter connected with the estate,
and she would tell him of what she was doing in the
garden, or in the house which had been built by his,
Oliver's, forbears.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not tell him, what was yet oddly true,
that the spirit of Godfrey still ruled The Chase. He
had inherited from his parents certain old-fashioned
ways and usages, to which he had clung with a sort
of determined obstinacy, and as to such matters, his
wife, in the days which were now beginning to seem
so far away and so unreal, had never even dreamt of
gainsaying him.</p>

<p class="indent">One of these usages was the leaving off of fires,
however cold the weather might be, on the first of
May, and this year, on the eve of May Day, Laura
remembered, and made up her mind that in this, as
in so much else, she would now be more submissive
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;274]</span>
to the dead than she had ever been to the living Godfrey.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Laura sat up late that night destroying and burning
certain papers connected with her past life. She
had come to realise how transitory a thing is human
existence, and she desired to leave nothing behind her
which might later give her child a clue to what sort
of unhappy, unnatural married life she and Godfrey
had led.</p>

<p class="indent">But it is always a painful task&mdash;that of turning
over long-dead embers.</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting there in the boudoir, close to the glowing
fire, and with a big old-fashioned despatch-box at
her side, she glanced at the letters which her husband
had written to her during their brief engagement,
and then she tied them up again and inscribed
them with names and dates. They might give Alice
pleasure some day, the more so that there was singularly
little else remaining to tell Godfrey's child
what he had been like at his best. She, Laura, only
knew&mdash;Alice, thank God, would never know, would
never understand&mdash;what melancholy memories these
rather formal, commonplace love-letters evoked in the
woman who as a girl had been their recipient.</p>

<p class="indent">The very few letters which her husband had written
to her during their married life, when he happened
to be in London or away on business, she had
always destroyed as they came. They had been brief,
business-life communications, generally concerning
something he desired to be done on the estate, or giving
her the instructions he wished to have telephoned
to the Bank.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;275]</span>
After glancing absently through them, she burnt
many letters which she now wondered why she had
kept&mdash;letters for the most part from friends of her
girlhood who had gradually drifted away from her,
and the memory of whom was fraught with pain. She
put aside the meagre packet of her brother's letters,
and then, at last she gathered up in her hands the
score or more large envelopes addressed in Oliver
Tropenell's clear, small, masculine handwriting.</p>

<p class="indent">Should she burn these too&mdash;or keep them?</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly she took out of its envelope the first of
Oliver's letters which she had kept&mdash;that in which
he expressed his willingness to become her trustee.
For the first time she forgot little Alice, forgot the day
when her daughter would read all that she found here,
in her mother's despatch-box, with the same eager interest
and perchance the same moved pleasure, which
she, Laura, had felt when reading the letters her own
beloved mother had left behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">Consideringly she glanced over the first real letter
Oliver Tropenell had ever written to her. Vividly
she remembered the whole circumstances surrounding
the sending and receiving of that letter, for
it had followed close on the scene which, try as she
might, she could not, even now, forget. It was in this
letter that she now held open in her hand, that Oliver
had heaped coals of fire on her head, by his quiet,
kindly acceptance of the trusteeship. There was unluckily
one passage she felt Alice should never have a
chance of reading&mdash;for it concerned Gillie. So,
though she was sorry to destroy the letter, she felt that
on the whole it would be better to burn it, here and
now.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;276]</span>
Hesitatingly she held out the large sheet to the
bright fire&mdash;and as she was in the act of doing so,
quite suddenly there flashed between the lines of
firm, black handwriting other lines&mdash;clear, brownish
lines&mdash;of the same handwriting. What an extraordinary,
amazing, incredible thing!</p>

<p class="indent">Laura slipped down on to the hearthrug from the
low arm-chair on which she had been sitting with her
despatch-box beside her, and bent forward, full of
tremulous excitement&mdash;her heart beating as it had
never beat before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"The decks are cleared between us, Laura, for
you know now that I love you. You said, 'Oh, but
this is terrible!' Yes, Laura, love is terrible. It is
not only cleansing, inspiring, and noble, it is terrible
too. Why is it that you so misunderstand, misjudge,
the one priceless gift, the only bit of Heaven, which
God or Nature&mdash;I care not which&mdash;has given to man
and woman?"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">She stopped reading for a moment, then forced
herself to go on, and the next few lines of that
strange, passionate secret letter, burnt themselves into
her brain.</p>

<p class="indent">She let the paper flutter down, and covered her face
with her hands. Could she&mdash;should she believe what
this man said?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"What you, judging by your words to-day, take to
be love is as little like that passion as a deep draught
of pure cold water to a man dying of thirst is like
the last glass of drugged beer imbibed by some poor
sot already drunk."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;277]</span>
It was a horrible simile, and yet&mdash;yes, she felt that
it was a true smile. For the first time Laura Pavely
dimly apprehended the meaning of love in the same
sense that Oliver Tropenell understood it.</p>

<p class="indent">She took up the sheet of paper again, and with
the tears falling down her cheeks, she read the postscript
which was superposed, as it were, on to the
first.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"God bless you, my dear love, and grant you the
peace which seems the only thing for which you
crave."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">After giving a shamed, furtive look round the empty
room, Laura Pavely pressed the letter to her lips, and
then she threw it into the fire, and watched it vanish
into brilliant flame, feeling as if a bit of her heart
were being burnt with it.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly she got up and went to the door; opening it,
she listened for a while.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole household was asleep, but even so, she
locked the door before coming back to her station by
the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">She put more coal on the now glowing embers, and
then she took up another letter Oliver had written to
her, a letter written from Paris just after he and
her brother had left London together for that long
holiday on the Continent. Outwardly it was a commonplace
letter enough concerning a change in certain
of her investments; but when she held it to the
fire, between the black lines there again started into
pulsing life another message, winged from his soul
to hers....
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;278]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"Laura, I have sworn not to speak to you of love,
and even in this letter which you will never see, I will
not break my oath. But as I go in and out of the old
Paris churches (where alone I find a certain measure
of solace and peace), in the women whom I see there
praying I often seem to discover something akin to
your spiritual and physical perfection.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is strange, considering the business on which
I am engaged, that I should feel thus drawn to haunt
these old, dim Paris churches, but there at least I
can escape from Gillie, of Gillie who talks perpetually
of Godfrey, your owner and your tyrant."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">And as she read these last words, there came a cold
feeling over Laura's heart. She realised, for the first
time, how Oliver had hated Godfrey.</p>

<p class="indent">She read on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"Gillie does not understand the reverence in which
I hold you. Sometimes when he speaks of you&mdash;of
you and Godfrey&mdash;I feel as if some day I shall strike
him on the mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">"But he is your brother, Laura. According to the
measure which is in the man he loves you, aye, and
even reverences you too, in his fashion; but with
this reverence is mingled a touch of pity, of contempt,
that you should be what he calls 'good.'"</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Good? Laura looked up and stared into the now
glowing fire. Good in a narrow, effortless sense she
had always been, but to the man who was so little her
owner, though so much at times her tyrant, she had
been, almost from the very first, hard, and utterly lacking
in sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;279]</span>
It was with relief that Laura burnt that letter.</p>

<p class="indent">The notes Oliver Tropenell had written to her in
London while he was conducting the investigation into
Godfrey Pavely's disappearance, held, to her disappointment,
no secret writing in between. But the
letters she had received from him since her widowhood
all had an invisible counterpart.</p>

<p class="indent">The first was written on ship-board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"Laura, I am now free to speak to you of love. The
world would say that I must wait in spirit as I have
waited in body, but I know at what a cost has been
bought the relief from the vow which I faithfully
kept.</p>

<p class="indent">"The past is dead, the future is my own. I look
back, dear love, to the few moments we had by the
great window in your drawing-room, when my mother
was talking to Alice over by the fire. You were so
gentle, so sweet, to me then. It was as if&mdash;God forgive
me for my presumption&mdash;you were regretting my
departure. Till that moment I had felt as if the man
who had once called you wife stood between us, an
angry, menacing shape. But he vanished then, in
that house of which he had never been the real master.
And since that day he has not haunted me as he
haunted me during those long long days of waiting
for the news I at once longed for and dreaded.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I come back I shall not ask you to love me,
I shall only humbly ask you to let me love you."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Laura went to her writing-table and turned on the
light. She moved as one walking in her sleep, for
she was in an extraordinary state of spiritual and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;280]</span>
mental exaltation. She drew a sheet of paper towards
her, and before burning the letter she still
held in her hand, she copied out, not all, but a certain
part of what had been written there in that invisible
ink which only flashed into being when held up against
a flame.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went back to the fire, and read the next
letter&mdash;and the next. In a sense they were alike&mdash;alike
in the measureless love, the almost anguished longing
for her presence they expressed, and in their abhorrence,
hatred, contempt for the man who had been
her husband. It was as if Oliver, in spite of his confident
words in the letter which had been written on
shipboard, could not forget Godfrey&mdash;as if perpetually
he felt the dead man's menacing presence to be there,
between them.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was amazed, troubled, and yet at the same
time profoundly stirred and excited by Oliver's retrospective
jealousy. It seemed to prove to her as nothing
else could have done how passionately, exclusively
he loved her, and had always loved her.</p>

<p class="indent">Though none of those about her were aware of
it, the mistress of The Chase became henceforth a
different woman. It was as though she had suddenly
become alive where she had been dead, articulate
instead of dumb.</p>

<p class="indent">Each night, when the house was plunged in darkness
and slumber, Laura would light three candles,
and read the words of longing and of love which
Oliver had written in between the formal lines of
the last letter she had received from him. And then,
when a new letter came, she would burn the one that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;281]</span>
had come before&mdash;the one whose contents she had already
long known by heart.</p>

<p class="indent">And as the spring wore into summer the thing
that became, apart from her child, the only real thing
in Laura Pavely's life, was her strong, secret link with
this man who she knew was coming back to claim her,
on whatever terms she chose to exact, as his own.
And she fell into a deep, brooding peace&mdash;the peace
of waiting. She was in no hurry to see Oliver again&mdash;indeed,
she sometimes had a disturbing dread that his
actual presence might destroy that amazing sense of
nearness she now felt to him. Unconsciously her own
letters to him became more intimate, more self-revealing;
she wrote less of Alice, more of herself.</p>

<p class="indent">The only uneaseful element in Laura Pavely's life
now was Katty Winslow. The two women never met
without Katty's making some mention of Godfrey.
And once Laura, when walking away with Katty from
Freshley Manor, where the two had met unexpectedly,
was sharply disturbed by something Katty said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm told Oliver Tropenell is coming back at or
after Christmas. Somehow I always associate him
with that awful time we had last January. I think
I shall try and be away when he is here&mdash;I don't suppose
he'll stay long."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty spoke with a kind of rather terrible hardness
in her voice, fixing her bright eyes on Laura's
quivering face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Instead of going away as he did, he ought to have
stayed and tried to clear up the mystery."</p>

<p class="indent">"But the mystery," said Laura in a low voice, "<i>was</i>
cleared up, Katty."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;282]</span>
But Katty shook her head. "To me the mystery
is a greater one than ever," she said decisively.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Early in September Laura received a letter written,
as were all Oliver's letters, in sober, measured
terms, and yet, even as she opened it, she felt with a
strange, strong instinct that something new was here.
And as she lived through the few hours which separated
her from night and solitude, she grew not only
more restless, but more certain, also, of some coming
change in her own life.</p>

<p class="indent">His open letter ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"I am writing in my new country house. Years
ago, after I first came out to Mexico, I stumbled across
the place by accident, and at once I made up my mind
that some day I would become its possessor. Over a
hundred years old, this little chteau, set on a steep
hillside, is said to have been built by a Frenchman of
genius who, having got into some bad scrape in Paris,
had to flee the country, while the old <i>rgime</i> was in
full fling.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I first came here, the house had stood empty
for over forty years. The garden, beautiful as it
was, had fallen into ruin. The fountains were broken,
the water no longer played, the formal arbours looked
like forest trees. White roses and jasmine mingled
with the dense southern vegetation, fighting a losing
fight.</p>

<p class="indent">"For a few brief weeks in '67 it was inhabited by
Maximilian and his young Empress&mdash;indeed, it is said
that the Emperor still haunts the cool large rooms
on the upper floor&mdash;there are but two storeys. So far
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;283]</span>
I have never met his noble ghost. I should not be
afraid if I did.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am beginning to think that it is time I came
back to Freshley for a while. But my plans are still
uncertain."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">At last came solitude, and the luminous darkness
of an early autumn night. Laura locked herself into
her room.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, instinct had not played her false, for the first
words of the secret letter ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"Laura, I am coming home. I had meant to linger
on here yet another month or six weeks, but now I ask
myself each hour of the day and night&mdash;why wait?</p>

<p class="indent">"The room in which I am sitting writing to you,
thinking of you, longing for you, was the room of
those two great lovers, Maximilian and his Carlotta.
The ghost of their love reminds me of the transience
of life. I have just walked across to the window,
thinking, thinking, thinking, my beloved, of you. For
I am haunted ever, Laura, by your wraith. I walk up
and down the terrace wondering if you will ever be
here in the body&mdash;as you already seem to be in the
spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am leaving at sunrise, and in three days I shall
be upon the sea. You will receive a cable, and so will
my mother. The thought of seeing you again&mdash;ah,
Laura, you will never know what rapture, so intense
as to be almost akin to pain, that thought gives me.
Lately your letters have seemed a thought more intimate,
more confiding&mdash;I dare not say less cold. But
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;284]</span>
I have sworn to myself, and I shall keep my oath, to
ask for nothing that cannot be freely given."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Two days later Laura received a wireless message
saying that Oliver would be at Freshley the next day.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;285]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="cap">A YEAR ago, almost to a day, Mrs. Tropenell had
been sitting where she was sitting now, awaiting
Laura Pavely. Everything looked exactly as it had
looked then in the pretty, low drawing-room of Freshley
Manor. Nothing had been added to, nothing withdrawn
from, the room. The same shaded reading-lamp
stood on the little table close to her elbow; the
very chrysanthemums might have been the same.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet with the woman sitting there everything
was different! Of all the sensations&mdash;unease, anxiety,
foreboding, jealousy&mdash;with which her heart had been
filled this time last year, only one survived, and of
that one she was secretly very much ashamed, for it
was jealousy.</p>

<p class="indent">And now she was trying with all the force of her
nature to banish the ugly thing from her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">What must be&mdash;must be! If Oliver's heart and
soul, as well as the whole of his ardent, virile physical
entity, desired Laura, then she, his mother, must help
him, as much as lay within her power, to compass
that desire.</p>

<p class="indent">Since Godfrey Pavely's death, it had been as if Mrs.
Tropenell's life had slipped back two or three years.
All these last few months she had written to Oliver
long diary letters, and Oliver on his side had written
to her vivid chronicles of his Mexican life. Perhaps
she saw less, rather than more of Laura than
she had done in the old days, for Laura, since her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;286]</span>
widowhood, had had more to do. She took her duties
as the present owner of The Chase very seriously.
Still, nothing was changed&mdash;while yet in a sense
everything had been changed&mdash;by the strange, untoward
death of Godfrey Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver's letters were no longer what they had been,
they were curiously different, and yet only she, his
mother, perchance would have seen the difference, had
one of his letters of two years ago and one of his letters
of to-day been put side by side.</p>

<p class="indent">The love he had borne for the Spanish woman, of
whom he had once spoken with such deep feeling, had
not affected his relations with his mother. But the
love he now bore Laura Pavely had. Not long ago
Laura had shown Mrs. Tropenell one of Oliver's letters,
and though there was really very little in it, she
had been oddly nervous and queer in her manner,
hardly giving the older woman time to read it through
before she had taken it back out of her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura had become more human since her husband's
death; it was as if a constricting band had been loosened
about her heart. Even so, Oliver's mother often
wondered sorely whether Laura would ever welcome
Oliver in any character save that of a devoted, discreet,
and selfless friend. She doubted it. And yet,
when he had written and suggested coming back now,
instead of waiting till Christmas, she had not said a
word to stop him. And the moment she had heard
that he had reached England, and that he was to be
here late on this very afternoon, she had sent a note
to The Chase and asked Laura to share their first
meal.</p>

<p class="indent">One thing had made a great difference to Mrs.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Tropenell's life during the last few months. That was
the constant, familiar presence of Lord St. Amant.
Now that he was Lord Lieutenant of the county, he
was far more at Knowlton Abbey than he had been
for some years, and somehow&mdash;neither could have
told you why&mdash;they had become even closer friends
than they had been before.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well understood that any supplicant who
had Mrs. Tropenell on his side could count on Lord
St. Amant's help and goodwill. Though she was of
course quite unaware of it, there were again rumours
through the whole of the country-side that soon the
mistress of Freshley Manor would become Lady St.
Amant, and that then the Abbey would be opened as
that great house had not been for close on forty years.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, to-night, Mrs. Tropenell suddenly remembered
that Lord St. Amant was coming to dinner&mdash;she
had forgotten it in the excitement of Oliver's
return. But she told herself, with a kind of eagerness,
that her old friend's presence might, after all, make
things easier for them all! It is always easier to
manage a party of four people than of three. Also,
it made less marked the fact of Laura's presence on
this, the first evening, of Oliver's return home.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell had not been able to discover from
her son's manner whether he was glad or sorry Laura
was coming to-night. And sitting there, waiting for
her guests, she anxiously debated within herself
whether Oliver would have preferred to see Laura
for the first time alone. Of course he could have
offered to go and fetch her; but he had not availed
himself of that excuse, and his mother knew that
she would be present at their meeting.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;288]</span>
The door opened, quietly, and as had been the case
a year ago, Mrs. Tropenell saw her beautiful visitor
before Laura knew that there was any one in the
darkened room.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more Mrs. Tropenell had a curious feeling as
if time had slipped back, and that everything was
happening over again. The only difference was that
Laura to-night was all in black, with no admixture of
white. Still, by an odd coincidence the gown she was
wearing was made exactly as had been that other gown
last year, and through the thin black folds of chiffon
her lovely white arms shone palely, revealingly....</p>

<p class="indent">And then, as her guest came into the circle of light,
Mrs. Tropenell realised with a feeling almost of shock
that Laura was very much changed. She no longer
had the sad, strained, rather severe look on her face
which had been there last year. She looked younger,
instead of older, and there was an expression of half-eager,
half-shrinking expectation on her face&mdash;to-night.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aunt Letty? How good of you to ask me&mdash;&mdash;"
But her voice sank away into silence as the sound of
quick footsteps were heard hastening across the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and Oliver Tropenell came in.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked straight to Laura, and took both her
hands in his. "You got my cable?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Laura blushed, overwhelmingly. She had
had said nothing of that cable to Mrs. Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">And as they stood there&mdash;Oliver still grasping
Laura's hands in his&mdash;the mother, looking on, saw
with a mixture of joy and of jealous pain that Laura
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;289]</span>
stood before him as if hypnotised, her heavy-lidded
blue eyes fixed upwards on his dark, glowing face.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly they all three heard the at once plaintive
and absurd hoot of Lord St. Amant's motor&mdash;and it
was as if a deep spell had suddenly been broken.
Slowly, reluctantly, Oliver released Laura's hands,
and Mrs. Tropenell exclaimed in a voice which had a
tremor in it: "It's Lord St. Amant, Oliver. I forgot
that he had asked himself to dinner to-night. He
said he could not come till half-past eight, but I suppose
he got away earlier than he expected to do."</p>

<p class="indent">And then with the coming into the room of her old
friend, life seemed suddenly to become again normal,
and though by no means passionless, yet lacking that
curious atmosphere of violent, speechless emotion that
had been there a moment or two ago. Of the four
it was Laura who seemed the most moved. She came
up and slipped her hand into Mrs. Tropenell's, holding
it tightly, probably unaware that she was doing so.</p>

<p class="indent">After the first few words of welcome to Oliver,
Lord St. Amant plunged into local talk with Mrs.
Tropenell, and as he did so, he looked a little wryly
at Laura. Why didn't she move away and talk to
Oliver? Why did she stick close like that to Letty&mdash;to
Letty, with whom he had hoped to spend a quiet,
cosy, cheerful evening?</p>

<p class="indent">But Laura, for the first time in her life, felt as if
she were no longer in full possession of herself. It
was as if she had passed into the secret keeping of
another human being; she had the sensation that her
mind was now in fee to another human mind, her
will overawed by another human will. And there was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;290]</span>
a side to her nature which rebelled against this sudden,
quick transference of herself.</p>

<p class="indent">With what she now half-realised to have been a kind
of self-imposed hypocrisy, she had told herself often,
during the last few months, that Oliver and she when
they again met would become dear, dear friends. He
would be the adorer, she the happy, calm, adored.
And that then, after a long probation, perhaps of
years, in any case not for a long, long time, she might
bring herself half reluctantly, and entirely for his sake,
to consider the question of&mdash;re-marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">But now? Since Oliver had taken her hands in his,
and gazed down speechlessly into her eyes, she had
known that it was he, not she, would set the pace in
their new relationship, and that however sincere his
self-imposed restraint and humility. So it was that
Laura instinctively clung to Mrs. Tropenell's hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The passion of love, which so often makes even
quite a young man feel older, steadier, more responsible,
has quite the opposite effect on a woman. To
every woman love brings back youth, and the deeper,
the more instinctive the love, the greater the tremors
and the uncertainties which, according to a hypocritical
convention, belong only to youth.</p>

<p class="indent">The years which Laura had spent with Godfrey
Pavely seemed obliterated. Memories of her married
life which had been very poignantly present in
the early days of her widowhood, filling her with
mingled repugnance, pain, and yes, remorse, were now
erased from the tablets of her mind. She felt as if it
was the young, ignorant Laura&mdash;that Laura who had
been so full of high, almost defiant ideals&mdash;who was
now standing, so full of confused longing and hope,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;291]</span>
if yet also a little fearful, on the threshold of a new,
wonderful life....</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Good-breeding and the observance of certain long-established,
social usages have an inestimable value in
all the great crises of human existence. To-night
each of the other three felt the comfort of Lord St.
Amant's presence among them. His agreeable ease of
manner, his pleasant, kindly deference to the older and
the younger lady, all helped to lessen the tension, and
make what each of his companions felt to be a breathless
time of waiting, easier to live through.</p>

<p class="indent">He himself was surprised and shocked by the change
he saw in Oliver Tropenell's face. Oliver looked
worn, haggard, yet filled with a kind of fierce gladness.
He appeared to-night not so much the happy,
as the exultant, conqueror of fate. He talked, and
talked well, of the political situation in Mexico, of
certain happenings which had taken place in England
during his absence, and though now and again Mrs.
Tropenell joined in the talk, on the whole she, like
Laura, was content to listen to the two men.</p>

<p class="indent">After dinner, while they were still alone in the
drawing-room, Laura began to talk, rather eagerly, of
her little Alice. She had begun to wonder whether
it would not be well for the child to go to school as
a weekly boarder. There was such a school within
reasonable motoring distance. Alice was becoming
rather too grown-up, and unchildlike. She had certain
little friends in the town of Pewsbury, but they
did not really touch her life.</p>

<p class="indent">But even as Mrs. Tropenell and Laura talked the
matter over, they both felt their talk to be unreal.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;292]</span>
Each of them knew that Laura's second marriage, if
ever marry she did, would completely alter the whole
situation with regard to Alice. Oliver was not the
man to hang up his hat in another man's house&mdash;besides,
why should he do so? The Chase belonged to
Alice, even now.</p>

<p class="indent">And then rather suddenly, Laura asked a question:
"How long is Oliver going to stay in England, Aunt
Letty?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Mrs. Tropenell quietly answered, "I should
think he would stay till after Christmas. I gather
everything is going on quite well out there, thanks to
Gillie." She waited a moment, and then repeated,
thoughtfully: "Yes&mdash;I feel sure Oliver means to
stay till after the New Year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">And then she stopped suddenly. There had come a
change over Laura's face. Laura had remembered
what Mrs. Tropenell for the moment had not done&mdash;that
early in January Godfrey Pavely would have been
dead exactly a year.</p>

<p class="indent">As ten o'clock struck, the other two came in, still
talking eagerly to one another.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant sat down by Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm going to have a little shooting party later on&mdash;not
now, but early in December," he said. "Mrs.
Tropenell is coming, and I hope Oliver too. I wonder
if you would do me the great pleasure of being
there, Laura? It's a long, long time since you honoured
the Abbey with your company&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He was smiling down at her. "I would ask Alice
to come too," he went on, "but I think she'd be bored!
Perhaps you'll be bored too? I'm not having any very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;293]</span>
brilliant or wonderful people, just a few of the neighbours
whom I feel I've rather neglected."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura laughed. "Of course I shall enjoy coming!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was standing by his mother. Suddenly he
muttered, "Mother? Ask Lord St. Amant to come
over and speak to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But before she could obey him, Lord St. Amant got
up and quickly came over to where Mrs. Tropenell
was sitting, leaving a vacant place by Laura.</p>

<p class="indent">With his back to the two younger people he sat
down close to Mrs. Tropenell, and all at once he saw
that her dark eyes were full of tears. He took her
hand and patted it gently. "I feel dreadfully <i>de trop</i>,"
he murmured. "Can't we go off, we two old folk,
to your little room, my dearest? I'm sure you've
something you want to show me there, or consult me
about?"</p>

<p class="indent">And while Lord St. Amant was saying this to his
old love, the two on the other side of the room were
silent, as if stricken dumb by the nearness each felt
to the other.</p>

<p class="indent">And at last it was Laura who broke the silence. "I
think I must be going home," she said uncertainly.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked across at her hostess. "I don't want to
make Lord St. Amant think he ought to go too. Perhaps
I can slip away quietly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll walk back with you."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver spoke with a kind of dry decision.</p>

<p class="indent">He got up. "Mother? I'm taking Laura home.
I shan't be long. Perhaps Lord St. Amant will stay
till I come back. It's quite early."</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to Laura, now standing by his side:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;294]</span>
"Say good-bye to them now. I'll fetch your shawl,
and we'll go out through the window."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura obeyed, as in a dream. "Good-bye, Aunt
Letty. Good-night, Lord St. Amant&mdash;I shall enjoy
being at the Abbey."</p>

<p class="indent">She suffered herself to be kissed by the one&mdash;her
hand pressed by the other. Then she turned as if in
answer to an unseen signal.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was already back in the room, her Shetland
shawl on his arm. He put it round her shoulders, taking
care not to touch her as he did so; then he opened
the long French window, and stood aside for a moment
while she stepped through into the moonlight,
out of doors.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">They were now in the beech avenue, in a darkness
that seemed the more profound because of the streaks
of silvery moonlight which lay just behind them. But
even so, the white shawl Laura was wearing showed
dimly against the depths of shade encompassing her.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once Oliver turned and said so suddenly that
she, walking by his side, started: "Laura? Do you
remember this time last year?"</p>

<p class="indent">And as she answered the one word "Yes," he went
on: "It was to-night, just a year ago, that I promised
to become your friend. And as long as you were
another man's wife, I kept my promise, at any rate
to the letter. If you tell me to go away for the next
three months, I will do so&mdash;to-morrow. If I stay, I
must stay, Laura, as your lover."</p>

<p class="indent">As she remained silent, he went on quickly: "Do
not misunderstand me. I only ask for the right to
love you&mdash;I do not ask for any return."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;295]</span>
She was filled with an exquisite, tremulous joy.
But that side of her nature which was restrained, and
which had been so atrophied, was ignorant of the
generosities of love, and shrank from quick surrender.
So all she said, in a voice which sounded very cold
to herself, was, "But that, Oliver, would surely not
be fair&mdash;to you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite fair!" he exclaimed eagerly&mdash;"quite fair. In
no case would I ever wish to obtain what was not
freely vouchsafed."</p>

<p class="indent">He muttered, in a voice so low as to be scarcely
audible, some further words which moved her
strangely, and vibrated to a chord which had never
before been touched, save to jar and to offend.</p>

<p class="indent">"To me aught else were sacrilege," were the words
Oliver Tropenell said.</p>

<p class="indent">By now Laura's eyes had become accustomed to
the darkness. She could see her companion's tall, at
once broad-shouldered and lean figure, standing at
rights angles to herself, keeping its distance....</p>

<p class="indent">Taking a step forward, she put out her right hand
a little blindly, and laid it on the sleeve of his coat.
Laura had always been an inarticulate woman, but
with that touch, that fleeting moment of contact between
them, something of what she was feeling took
flight from her heart to his&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Laura?"</p>

<p class="indent">He grasped her hands as he had grasped them three
hours ago when they had first met in his mother's
presence. And then again he breathed her name. But
this time the touch of doubting, incredulous joy had
passed into something ardent, exultant, possessive, and
she was in his arms&mdash;her self-absorption, her fastidiousness,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;296]</span>
her lifelong shrinking from any strong emotion,
swept away by a force which she had once only
known sufficiently to abhor and to condemn, but which
she now felt to be divine.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Oliver Tropenell said a strange thing
indeed. "To have secured this immortal moment, I
would willingly die a shameful, ignoble death to-morrow,"
were the words he whispered, as he strained
Laura to his heart, as his lips sought and found her
lips....</p>

<p class="indent">At last they paced slowly on, and Laura found herself
secretly exulting in the violence of Oliver's emotion,
and in the broken, passionate terms of endearment
with which he endowed her. That her response
was that of a girl rather than that of a woman was
to her lover an added ecstasy. It banished the hateful,
earthy shade of Godfrey Pavely&mdash;that shade
which had haunted Oliver Tropenell all that evening,
even in his mother's house.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as they were about to step out from under the
arch of the beech trees on to the high road, he again
took her in his arms. "Laura?" he whispered. "May
I tell my mother?" But as he felt her hesitating:
"No!" he exclaimed. "Forget that I asked you that!
We will say nothing yet. Secrecy is a delicious concomitant
of love." She heard the added, whispered
words, uttered as if to his own heart, "At least so I
have ever found it." And they were words which a
little troubled Laura. Surely she was the first woman
he had ever loved?</p>

<p class="indent">"Aunt Letty has a right to know," she murmured.
"But no one else, Oliver, must know, till January is
past." And then she hung her head, perchance a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;297]</span>
little ashamed of this harking back to the conventions
of her everyday life.</p>

<p class="indent">He was surprised to hear her say further and with
an effort, "I would rather Lord St. Amant didn't
know. We shall be staying at Knowlton Abbey together
in December."</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall," he said exultantly. "For that I thank
God!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then suddenly he released her from out of his
strong encompassing arms, and stooping down very
low he kissed the hem of her long black gown....</p>

<p class="indent">After they had parted Oliver Tropenell waited on
and on in the dark garden till he heard Lord St.
Amant's car drive away. Then he walked quickly
across the lawn and back into his mother's drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mother?" he said briefly. "Laura and I are going
to be married. But we do not wish any one to
know this till&mdash;till February."</p>

<p class="indent">Even now he could not wholly banish Godfrey
Pavely's intrusive presence from his Laura-filled heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="cap">TO any imaginative mind there is surely something
awe-inspiring in the thought of the constant
secret interlocking of lives which seem as unlikely
ever to meet, in a decisive sense, as are two
parallel lines.</p>

<p class="indent">How amazed, how bewildered, Laura Pavely would
have been could she have visioned even a hundredth
part of the feeling concerning herself which filled her
nearest neighbour, Katty Winslow's, heart!</p>

<p class="indent">Even in the old days Katty had disliked Laura,
and had regarded her with a mixture of contempt and
envy. And now that Oliver Tropenell had come back&mdash;now
that Katty suspected him of being Laura's potential,
if not actual, lover&mdash;she grew to hate the
woman who had always been kind to her with an intense,
calculating hate.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed as if she hardly ever looked out of one
of her windows without seeing Oliver on his way to
The Chase, or Laura on her way to Freshley&mdash;and
this although the secret lovers behaved with great
discretion, for Oliver was less, rather than more, with
Laura than he used to be in the old days when Godfrey
was alive. Also, wherever Laura happened to
be, her child&mdash;cheerful, eager little Alice&mdash;was sure
to be close by.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura, so much Katty believed herself to have discovered,
was now happy, in her cold, unemotional
way, in the possession of a man's ardent devotion,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;299]</span>
while she, Katty, who had asked so comparatively
little of life, had been deprived of the one human
being who could, and perhaps in time would, have
given her all she wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Godfrey Pavely! No one ever spoke of him
now, in that neighbourhood where once he had counted
for so much. Already it was as if he had never been.
But to Katty Winslow he was still an insistent, dominating
presence. Often she brooded over his untimely
death, and sometimes she upbraided herself for not
having made some sort of effort to solve the mystery.
The reward was still in being, but one day, lately, when
she had made some allusion to it in Laura's presence,
Laura, reddening, had observed that she was thinking
of withdrawing it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord St. Amant and the Scotland Yard people
never approved of it," she said, "and as you know,
Katty, it has led to nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">Early in October, Laura, Oliver and Alice, passing
by Rosedean one day, turned in through the gate.
"Why shouldn't we go in and ask Katty to come to
tea?" It was Laura's suggestion. Somehow she
was sorry for Katty&mdash;increasingly sorry. Yet she
could not help feeling glad when Harber coldly informed
her that Mrs. Winslow had left home, and
would not be back for ten days.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At the very time that happy little group of people
was at her door, Katty herself was standing in a
queue of people waiting to take her ticket at York
station.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Mrs. Winslow would have been honestly
surprised had any one told her she was sentimental,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;300]</span>
she had actually come down by an earlier train than
was necessary in order that she might retrace the
ways that she and her friend had trodden together a
year ago in January.</p>

<p class="indent">She had first gone to the Minster, moving swiftly
along the paved streets where she had walked and
talked slowly, pleasantly, with the dead man. Then
she had wandered off to the picturesque thoroughfare
lined with curiosity shops. How kind, how generous
Godfrey had been to her just here! Every
time she looked up in her pretty little drawing-room
at Rosedean, his gift met her eye.</p>

<p class="indent">While she was engaged on this strange, painful pilgrimage,
there welled up in Katty's heart a flood of
agonised regret and resentment. She told herself
bitterly that Godfrey's death had aged her&mdash;taken
the spring out of her. Small wonder indeed that in
these last few weeks she should have come to hate
Laura with a steady, burning flame of hate....</p>

<p class="indent">So it was that Katty Winslow was in a queer mental
and physical state when she returned to the big
railway station to complete her journey. She did not
feel at all in the mood to face the gay little houseparty
where she was sure of an uproarious, as well
as of an affectionate, welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">As she stood in the queue of rather rough North-country
folk, waiting to take her third-class ticket,
there swept over her a sudden, vivid recollection of
that incident&mdash;the hearing of a voice which at the
time had seemed so oddly familiar&mdash;which had happened
on the day she had parted from Godfrey Pavely
for the last time.</p>

<p class="indent">And then&mdash;as in a blinding, yet illuminating flash&mdash;there
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;301]</span>
came to her the conviction, nay, more, the
certain knowledge, as to whose voice it had been
that she had heard on the last occasion when she had
stood there, in the large, bare booking office. The
voice she had heard&mdash;she was quite, <i>quite</i> sure of it
now, it admitted of no doubt in her mind at all&mdash;had
been the peculiar, rather high-pitched, voice of
Gillie Baynton....</p>

<p class="indent">She visualised the arresting appearance of the man
who had been the owner of the voice, and who had
gazed at her with that rather impudent, jeering glance
of bold admiration. Of course it was Gillie, but Gillie
disguised&mdash;Gillie with his cheeks tinted a curious
greenish-orange colour, Gillie with his fair hair dyed
black, Gillie&mdash;her brain suddenly supplied the link she
was seeking for feverishly&mdash;<i>exactly answering to the
description of the sinister Fernando Apra&mdash;the self-confessed
murderer of Godfrey Pavely</i>.
Katty left the queue in which she was standing, and
walked across to a bench.</p>

<p class="indent">There she sat down, and, heedless of the people
about her, put her chin on her hand and stared before
her.</p>

<p class="indent">What did her new knowledge portend? What did
it lead to? Was Laura associated with this extraordinary,
bewildering discovery of hers? But the
questions she put to herself remained unanswered.
She failed to unravel even a little strand of the tangled
skein.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly she got up again, and once more took her
place in the queue outside the booking office. It would
be folly to lose her train because of this discovery,
astounding, illuminating, as it was.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;302]</span>
She was so shaken, so excited, that she longed to
confide in one of the Haworths, brother or sister, to
whose house she was going&mdash;but some deep, secretive
instinct caused her to refrain from doing that. Still,
she was so far unlike herself, that after her arrival the
members of the merry party all commented to one another
on the change they saw in her.</p>

<p class="indent">"She's as pretty as ever," summed up one of them
at last, "but somehow she looks different."</p>

<p class="indent">All that night Katty lay awake, thinking, thinking&mdash;trying
to put together a human puzzle of which the
pieces would not fit. Gillie Baynton, even if he disliked
his brother-in-law, had no motive for doing the
awful thing she was now beginning to suspect he had
done. She found herself floating about in a chartless
sea of conjectures, of suspicions....</p>

<p class="indent">She felt better, more in possession of herself, the
next morning. Yet she was still oppressed with an
awful sense of bewilderment and horror, uncertain,
too, as to what use she could make of her new knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">Should she go straight up to town and tell Sir
Angus Kinross of what had happened to her yesterday?
Somehow she shrank from doing that. He
would suspect her of simply trying to snatch the reward.
Katty had never been quite at ease with the
Commissioner of Police&mdash;never quite sure as to what
he knew, or did not know, of her past relations to
Godfrey Pavely. And yet those relations had been
innocent enough, in all conscience! Sometimes Katty,
when thinking of those terrible times last January,
had felt sorry she had not told Sir Angus the truth as
to that joint journey to York. But, having hidden the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;303]</span>
fact at first, she had been ashamed to confess it later&mdash;and
now she would have to confess it.</p>

<p class="indent">She was still in this anxious, debating-within-herself
frame of mind when, at luncheon, something happened
which seemed to open a way before her.</p>

<p class="indent">Her host, Tony Haworth, was talking of the neighbourhood,
and he said, rather ruefully: "Of course
a man like that old rascal who calls himself Greville
Howard is worse than no good as a neighbour! For
one thing he's a regular recluse. He hardly ever goes
outside his park gates. I suppose the conscience of a
man who's done so many naughty deeds in a good
world is apt to make him feel a bit nervous!"</p>

<p class="indent">"How far off does he live from here?" asked Katty
slowly. The scene at the inquest rose up before her,
especially that moment when "Greville Howard's" affidavit,
accompanied by his doctor's certificate, had been
read aloud amid a ripple of amusement from the general
public present.</p>

<p class="indent">"About four miles&mdash;but no one ever sees him. He's
more or less of an invalid. It's a beautiful old house,
and they say he's got some wonderful pictures and
furniture there."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does he live quite alone?"</p>

<p class="indent">Her host hesitated. "Well, yes&mdash;but sometimes he
has a lady of sorts there. He brought one back from
France last June (he has a villa at Monte Carlo), and
then&mdash;" Tony Haworth hesitated again, but Katty
was looking at him eagerly&mdash;"then something dreadful
happened! The poor woman died. She got a chill,
developed pneumonia, and, to do the old rascal justice,
he got down the biggest man he could from town. But
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;304]</span>
it was no good&mdash;she died just the same! As far as
I know, he's quite alone now&mdash;and precious lonely he
must find it!"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty was very silent for the rest of the meal,
and after luncheon she drew her host aside.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here," she said abruptly. "I've something
to tell you, Tony. I want to see that person we were
speaking about&mdash;I mean Greville Howard. I want
to see him about Godfrey Pavely. You know he is
one of the few people who actually saw the man who
killed Godfrey. At the time of the inquest he was ill,
and so couldn't attend&mdash;I think the police thought he
shammed illness. Sir Angus Kinross was convinced
(and so was Lord St. Amant) that this Greville Howard
knew a great deal more about Fernando Apra
than he was willing to tell."</p>

<p class="indent">Tony Haworth was much taken aback.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear girl, I don't think there's a chance of
your getting at him! However, of course you shall
be driven over as soon as you like. He <i>may</i> see you&mdash;<i>you're</i>
not the sort of person he's afraid of."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her a little sharply. "You never had
any money dealings with him, had you, Katty? Now,
honour bright&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course not," she laughed. "Is it likely? My
husband may have had, in the long, long ago&mdash;but I,
never!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">An hour or so later, Katty Winslow, alone in her
friend's motor, found herself before the lodge of the
big lonely place where the retired money-lender&mdash;a
Yorkshireman by birth&mdash;had set up his household
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;305]</span>
gods. The great gates were closed and locked, but
there was a bell, and she rang it.</p>

<p class="indent">After a certain interval the lodge-keeper came out.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've come to see Mr. Greville Howard," she explained,
and smiled amiably at the man.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her doubtfully. "The master don't
see no one excepting by appointment," he said gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think he'll see me."</p>

<p class="indent">And then an extraordinary piece of luck befell
Katty Winslow. While she was standing there, parleying,
she suddenly saw a man inside the park, walking
towards the gates.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think," she said boldly, "that that <i>is</i> Mr. Greville
Howard?" and she saw by the lodgekeeper's face that
she was right in her guess.</p>

<p class="indent">Moving gracefully forward, she slid past him, and
thus she stood just within the gates, while slowly
there advanced towards her&mdash;and, had she but known
it, towards many others&mdash;Fate, in the person of a tall,
thin, some would have said a very distinguished-looking,
elderly man.</p>

<p class="indent">As he came up, he looked at Katty with a measuring,
thoughtful glance, and his eyes travelled beyond
her to the well-appointed motor drawn up in
the lonely country road outside.</p>

<p class="indent">Now this was the sort of situation to amuse and
stimulate, rather than alarm, Katty, the more so that
the stranger, who was now close to her, was looking
at her pleasantly rather than otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">She took a step towards him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Howard?" she exclaimed, in her full, agreeable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;306]</span>
voice. "I wonder if you would be so kind as
to grant me a short interview? I want to see you
about the late Mr. Godfrey Pavely. He was a great
friend of mine."</p>

<p class="indent">As she uttered the dead banker's name, Greville
Howard's face stiffened into sudden watchfulness.
But he said slowly: "May I enquire your name,
madam?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh yes," she said eagerly. "My name is Winslow&mdash;I
am Mrs. Winslow. I was Godfrey Pavely's oldest
friend&mdash;we were children together."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Your name comes back to
me. I think you were mentioned at the inquest, Mrs.
Winslow? But you did not give any evidence, if I
remember rightly."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I was not asked to give evidence," she answered.
"And you yourself, Mr. Howard, were too
ill to come and say what you knew about&mdash;about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"About Mr. Pavely's murderer," he said smoothly.</p>

<p class="indent">They were now walking side by side slowly away
from the gate, down a broad, well-kept carriage road,
the lodge-keeper staring after them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know Sir Angus Kinross?" asked Katty's
companion suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him a curious, side-glance look. "I saw
him several times last winter," she said hesitatingly.
"But, Mr. Howard?&mdash;I don't like him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Neither do I." He snapped the words out. "I
could have told Scotland Yard a good deal if Kinross
had taken the trouble to be civil to me&mdash;but he sent
me down a fellow whose manner I exceedingly resented."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;307]</span>
There followed a long pause. Katty became unpleasantly
aware that this strange-looking man&mdash;she
wondered how old he was&mdash;sixty-five?&mdash;seventy?&mdash;was
looking at her with a rather pitiless scrutiny.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can see that you are anxious to know the truth,"
he observed. He added: "Are you aware that the
reward has just been withdrawn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I didn't know that. But I'm not surprised,"
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">She glanced at him, puzzled, and a little nervous.
His keen eyes, grey-green in tint, were much younger
than the rest of his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I know part of the truth," he went on.
"And perhaps you will be able to supply the other
part, Mrs. Winslow. I confess to a certain curiosity
about the matter."</p>

<p class="indent">They were now within sight of a charming-looking
old house. It was charming, and yet there was something
forlorn about its very perfection. The low, oak,
nail-studded front door was shut, not hospitably open&mdash;as
is generally the case with the door of a Yorkshire
country house. But Mr. Greville Howard pulled the
bell, and at once the door was opened by a respectable-looking
manservant.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am taking this lady to my study, and I do not
wish to be disturbed till I ring. When I ring you
can bring tea."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty followed her host through a short, vaulted
passage into a square hall. It was a beautiful apartment,
in keeping with the delicate, austere charm of
the house outside. And round the hall there were
some fine Dutch easel pictures.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;308]</span>
Out of the hall there opened various doors. Greville
Howard pushed open one, already ajar, and Katty
walked through into what she at once realised was
her companion's own habitual living-room.</p>

<p class="indent">With all her cleverness, and her acquaintance with
the art-furnishing jargon of the day, Katty would have
been surprised to know the value of the contents of
this comparatively small room. It contained some
notable examples of the best period of early French
Empire furniture. This was specially true of the mahogany
and brass inlaid dwarf bookcases which ran
round three sides of the apartment. Above the bookcases,
against the turquoise-blue silk with which the
walls were hung, were a number of Meissonier's paintings
of Napoleon.</p>

<p class="indent">On the mantelpiece was a marble bust of the young
Csar as First Consul, and above it a delightful portrait
of Mademoiselle Georges, by Grard. As he
briefly informed his visitor of the portrait's identity,
Mr. Greville Howard felt just a little disappointed
that Mrs. Winslow did not seem more interested.</p>

<p class="indent">During the last quarter of an hour he had recaptured
what at the time of the affair had been a very
definite impression as to the relations of his present
visitor and the Wiltshire banker. But now, seeing
Katty there before him, looking so much at her ease,
so&mdash;so ladylike (Mr. Greville Howard's own word),
he hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray sit down," he said courteously, "and make
yourself comfortable, Mrs. Winslow. It's getting
rather chilly."</p>

<p class="indent">Her host put on another log as he spoke, and pulled
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;309]</span>
a low, easy chair up close to the fire. And then he
himself sat down, at right angles to his attractive
guest, in a curiously-shaped winged chair which had
once been part of the furniture in the Empress Josphine's
music-room at Malmaison.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;310]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="cap">IT had been a little after three o'clock when Katty
Winslow entered Mr. Greville Howard's study&mdash;and
now it was half-past four. The room had grown
gradually darker, but the fire threw out a glimmering
light on the faces of the two sitting there.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once Katty realised, with a sense of acute discomfiture,
that as yet her host had said nothing&mdash;nothing,
at least, that mattered. He had drawn out
of her, with extraordinary patience, courtesy, and intelligence,
all that <i>she</i> could tell <i>him</i>&mdash;of what had
happened before, and about the time of, Godfrey
Pavely's death.</p>

<p class="indent">She had even told him of the two anonymous letters
received by Godfrey Pavely&mdash;but with regard
to them she had of course deliberately lied, stating
that Godfrey had shown them to her, and that she still
had no idea from whence they came.</p>

<p class="indent">Her listener had made very few comments, but he
had shown, quite early in their conversation, a special
interest in the personality of Oliver Tropenell. He
had even extracted from Katty a physical description
of the man she declared to be now Mrs. Pavely's lover,
and probable future husband.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, say during the first half-hour, she had felt
extraordinarily at ease with the remarkable old man
who had listened to her so attentively, while the fine
eyes, which were the most arresting feature of his
delicate, highly intelligent countenance, were fixed on
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;311]</span>
her flushed face. But now, with the shadows of evening
falling, she could not see him so clearly, and
there came a cold feeling about Katty Winslow's
heart. There was very little concerning her own past
relations with Godfrey Pavely that this stranger did
not now know. She felt as if he had uncovered all
the wrappings which enfolded her restless, vindictive,
jealous soul. But she herself, so far, had learnt nothing
from him.</p>

<p class="indent">She began to feel very tired, and suddenly, whilst
answering one of his searching, gentle questions, her
voice broke, and she burst into tears.</p>

<p class="indent">He leant quickly forward, and laid his thin, delicate
right hand on hers. "My dear Mrs. Winslow, please
forgive me! This has been a painful ordeal for you.
I feel like a Grand Inquisitor! But now I am going
to bring you comfort&mdash;I ought not to say joy. But
before I do so I am going to make you take a cup of
tea&mdash;and a little bread and butter. Then, afterwards,
I will show you that I appreciate your generous confidence
in telling me all that you have done."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment, and then said impressively, "I
am going to put you in the way to make it possible
for you to avenge your dead friend, I think I may
also say <i>my</i> dead friend, for Mr. Godfrey Pavely and
I had some very interesting and pleasant dealings
with one another, and that over many years."</p>

<p class="indent">She was soothed by the really kind tone of his low
voice, even by the caressing quality of his light touch,
and her sobs died down.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Howard took his hand away, and pressed a
button close to his chair. A moment later a tray appeared
with tea, cake, bread and butter, and a little
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;312]</span>
spirit lamp on which there stood what looked like a
gold tea-kettle.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can put on the light, Denton," and there came
a pleasant glow of suffused light over the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps you will be so kind as to make the tea?"
said Mr. Howard in his full, low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty smiled her assent, and turned obediently towards
the little table which had been placed by her
elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw that the kettle was so fixed by a clever arrangement
that there was no fear of accident, though
the water in it had been brought in almost boiling
on the lacquer tray&mdash;a tray which was as exquisitely
choice in its way as was everything else in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty, as we know, was used to making afternoon
tea. Very deftly she put three teaspoonfuls of tea
into the teapot, and then poured out the boiling water
from the bright yellow kettle. She was surprised at
its weight.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Greville Howard, "it's rather heavy&mdash;gold
always is. It's fifteen-carat gold. I bought that
kettle years ago, in Paris. It took my fancy."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at the clock. "We will give the tea three
minutes to draw," he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he began to talk to her about the people
with whom she was staying, the people who had
never seen him, but who had so deep&mdash;it now seemed
to her so unreasoning and unreasonable&mdash;a prejudice
against him. And what he had to say about them
amused, even diverted, Katty, so shrewd were his
thrusts, so true his appreciation of the faults and the
virtues of dear Helen and Tony Haworth. But how
on earth had he learnt all that?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;313]</span>
And then, at the end of the three minutes, she
poured the tea into the transparent blue-and-white Chinese
porcelain cups.</p>

<p class="indent">"No milk, no sugar, no cream for me," he said.
"Only a slice of that lemon."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard watched Katty take her tea, and
eat the bread and butter and the cake&mdash;daintily, but
with a good appetite. He watched her with the pleasant
sensations that most men felt when watching Katty
do anything&mdash;the feeling that she was not only very
pretty, but very healthy too, and agreeable to look
upon, a most satisfactory, satisfying feminine presence.</p>

<p class="indent">After she had finished, he again touched his invisible
button, and the tray was taken swiftly and
noiselessly away.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"And now," he said, "I am going to tell you <i>my</i>
part of this strange story, and you will see, Mrs.
Winslow, that the two parts&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;fit,
and that the vengeance for which I see you crave, is
in your hands. I shall further show you how to arrange
so that you need not appear in the matter if
Sir Angus Kinross prove kind, as I feel sure he will
be&mdash;to you."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty clasped her hands together tightly. She felt
terribly moved and excited. Vengeance? What did
this wonderful old man mean?</p>

<p class="indent">"Dealers in money," began Mr. Greville Howard
thoughtfully, "have to run their own international
police, and that, my dear young lady, is especially true
of the kind of business which built up what I think I
may truly call my fame, as well as my fortune. During
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;314]</span>
something like forty years I paid a large subsidy
each year to the most noted firm of private detectives
in the world&mdash;a firm, I must tell you, who have their
headquarters in Paris. Though I no longer pay them
this subsidy, for mine was a one-man business, I still
sometimes have reason to employ them. They throw
out their tentacles all over the world, and their chief,
a most intelligent, cultivated man, is by way of being
quite a good friend of mine. I always thoroughly
enjoy a chat with him when I am going through Paris
on my way to my villa in the South of France. It
is to this man that the credit of what I am about
to tell you, the credit, that is, of certain curious discoveries
connected with the mystery of Mr. Godfrey
Pavely's death, is due."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard waited a few moments, and then
he spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must begin at the beginning by telling you that
when this Fernando Apra came to see me, I formed
two very distinct opinions. The one, which is now
confirmed by what you have told me, was that the
man was not a Portuguese; the other was that he
was 'made up.' I felt certain that his hair was dyed,
and the skin of his face, neck and hands tinted. He
was a very clever fellow, and played his part in a
capital manner. But I took him for an adventurer, a
man of straw, as the French say, and I believed that
Mr. Godfrey Pavely was being taken in by him. Yet
there were certain things about this Apra that puzzled
me&mdash;that I couldn't make out. An adventurer very
rarely goes to the pains of disguising himself physically,
for his object is to appear as natural as possible.
There was yet another reason why the adventurer view
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;315]</span>
seemed false. All the time we were talking, all the
time he was enthusing&mdash;if I may use a very ugly modern
word&mdash;about the prospects of this gambling concession,
I had the increasing conviction that he was
not serious, that he was not <i>out for business</i>&mdash;that he
had come to see me with some other motive than
that of wishing me to take an interest in his scheme."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard leant forward, and gazed earnestly
into his visitor's face. "I felt this so strongly that
the thought did actually flash across me more than
once&mdash;'Is this man engaged in establishing an alibi?'
When I asked him for the name and address of the
French references to which Mr. Pavely had made an
allusion in his letter of introduction, I saw that he
was rather reluctant to give me the names. Still he
did do so at last, the bankers being&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Messrs. Zosean &amp; Co.," exclaimed Katty. "I have
sometimes thought of going to see them."</p>

<p class="indent">"You would have had your journey for nothing.
As I shall soon show you, they were&mdash;they still are&mdash;an
unconscious link in the chain. To return to Apra,
as we must still call him. So little was I impressed
by this peculiar person that I expected to hear nothing
more of him or of his gambling concern. But one day
I received a letter from Mr. Godfrey Pavely, telling
me that he himself wished to see me with reference to
the same matter. I saw at once that <i>he</i> really did mean
business. He was very much excited about the prospects
of the undertaking."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Greville Howard paused. He looked attentively
at his visitor, but Katty's face told him nothing,
and he continued: "I cross-examined him rather
carefully about this Fernando Apra, and I discovered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;316]</span>
that he had only seen the fellow twice, each time
rather late in the evening, and by artificial light. I
then told him of my conviction that Apra was playing
a part, but he scouted the idea. Our unfortunate
friend was a very obstinate man, Mrs. Winslow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Katty in a low voice. "That is quite
true."</p>

<p class="indent">"And then," went on the other thoughtfully, "Pavely
was also exceedingly susceptible to flattery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Katty nodded. This Mr. Greville Howard knew
almost too much.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, as you know, he came down again to see me&mdash;and
the next thing I heard was that he had disappeared!
At once&mdash;days before Mrs. Pavely received
that very singular letter&mdash;I associated Apra with the
mystery. It was, however, no business of mine to
teach the police their business, though I thought it
probable that there would come a moment when I
should have to intervene, and reveal the little that I
knew. That moment came when Mr. Pavely's body
was discovered in Apra's office at Duke House."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard straightened himself somewhat in
his easy chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"I at once wrote, as I felt in duty bound, to Sir
Angus Kinross. I had met him, under rather unfortunate
circumstances, some years ago, before he became
Commissioner of Police. That, doubtless, had
given him a prejudice against me. Be that as it may,
instead of taking advantage of my offer to tell him in
confidence all I knew, he sent a most unpleasant person
down to interview me. This man, a pompous,
ignorant fellow, came twice&mdash;once before the inquest,
once after the inquest. I naturally took a special
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;317]</span>
pleasure in misleading him, and in keeping to myself
what I could have told. But though I was able to give
him the impression I desired to convey, he was not
able to keep anything he knew from <i>me</i>; and, at the
end of our second interview, he let out that the police
had very little doubt that two men had been concerned
in the actual murder&mdash;for murder the police by then
believed it to be&mdash;of Mr. Godfrey Pavely."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard stopped speaking for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Two men?" repeated Katty in a bewildered tone.</p>

<p class="indent">And the other nodded, coolly. "Yes, that is the
opinion they formed, very early in the day, at Scotland
Yard. They also made up their minds that it
would be one of those numerous murders of which
the perpetrators are never discovered. And, but for
you and me, Mrs. Winslow, the very clever perpetrators
of this wonderfully well planned murder would
have escaped scot-free."</p>

<p class="indent">He touched his invisible bell, and his man answered
it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Make up the fire," he said, "&mdash;a good lasting fire."</p>

<p class="indent">When this had been done, he again turned to
Katty. "We now," he said, "come to the <i>really</i> exciting
part of my story. Up to now, I think I have
told you nothing that you did not know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I had no idea," said Katty in a low, tense voice,
"that the police believed there were <i>two</i> people concerned
with Godfrey's death."</p>

<p class="indent">She was trying, desperately, to put the puzzle together&mdash;and
failing.</p>

<p class="indent">"I crossed to France last March," went on Greville
Howard musingly, "and, inspired I must confess by a
mere feeling of idle curiosity, I stopped in Paris two
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;318]</span>
days in order to see, first, Messrs. Zosean, and secondly
Henri Lutin, the head of the Detective Agency
with whom, as I told you just now, I have long been
in such cordial relations. I called first on Henri Lutin
and reminded him of the story of Mr. Pavely's disappearance,
and of the subsequent finding of his body in
this Fernando Apra's office. I also informed him
that I would go up to a certain modest sum in pursuit
of independent enquiries if he would undertake to
make them. He consented, and as a preliminary, gave
me some information with regard to Messrs. Zosean.
Provided with a good introduction I called on these
bankers, and this is what I learnt. Messrs. Zosean,
with that curious incuriousness which is so very
French, scarcely knew anything of what had happened,
though they were vaguely aware that a man had been
found killed by accident in their mysterious client's
office, for Fernando Apra was their client, but only&mdash;note
this, for it is important&mdash;a client of a few weeks'
standing. He had paid in to their bank, some two
months before Mr. Pavely's death, the very considerable
sum of one million francs, forty thousand pounds,
on deposit. One of the junior partners saw him&mdash;only
once, late in the afternoon."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard waited a long moment&mdash;then he
added impressively: "<i>And the man whom they to
this day believe to be Fernando Apra bore no physical
resemblance at all to the man who visited me here
under that name</i>. In fact, the description given by
the bankers exactly tallies with that of another man&mdash;of
a man whom <i>you</i> described to me about an hour
ago."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't quite understand," faltered Katty.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;319]</span>
"Don't you? Think a little, Mrs. Winslow, and
you will agree with me that the real client of Messrs.
Zosean was Oliver Tropenell, the man whom you believe
to be the lover and future husband of Mrs.
Pavely."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty uttered an inarticulate exclamation&mdash;was it
of surprise or of satisfaction? Her host took no notice
of it, and continued his narrative:</p>

<p class="indent">"One day&mdash;I soon found it to have been the day
following that on which the murder of Mr. Pavely
was presumably committed&mdash;a man who, I feel sure,
was <i>my</i> Fernando Apra, turned up at Messrs. Zosean
with a cheque, the fact that he was coming having
been notified to the bank from London by telephone.
He drew out the greater part of the money lodged in
the name of Apra in Messrs. Zosean's bank&mdash;not all,
mark you, for some eight thousand pounds was left in,
and that eight thousand pounds, Mrs. Winslow, is still
there, undisturbed. I doubt myself if it will ever be
claimed!</p>

<p class="indent">"I then, following the plan laid down for me by
Henri Lutin, asked Messrs. Zosean at what hotel
Fernando Apra had stayed. I was given two addresses.
These addresses I handed on to my friend
the secret enquiry agent, and the rest of the story belongs
to him, for it was Lutin who discovered all that
I am now going to tell you."</p>

<p class="indent">Greville Howard stopped speaking. He looked
thoughtfully at the woman who sat ensconced in the
low arm-chair opposite him.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt rather as a man may be supposed to feel
who is about to put a light to a fuse which will in due
course blow up a powder magazine. There even came
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;320]</span>
over his subtle, tortuous mind a thrill of pity for the
man whom he was about to sacrifice to this pretty
woman's desire for vengeance and&mdash;as he could not
help seeing&mdash;jealous hatred of another woman who
might, for all he knew, be in every way more worthy
of his interest, even of his admiration, than she who
sat there looking at him with gleaming eyes and parted
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">But Greville Howard, like all his kind, was a fatalist
as well as something of a philosopher. He could
not have lived the life he had led, and done the work
which had built up his great fortune, had he been
anything else, and Katty had come at a very fortunate
psychological moment for him&mdash;as well as for
herself. Greville Howard was becoming what he had
rarely ever been&mdash;bored; he was longing consciously
for a fresh interest and for a new companionship in
his life. And so:</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps you will be disappointed at the meagreness
of what I am about to tell you, but you may believe
me when I say that it is information which will
make the way of Sir Angus Kinross quite clear, and
which may bring one, if not two, men to the gallows."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty gave a little involuntary gasp. But he went
on:</p>

<p class="indent">"It did not take my friend Lutin very long to discover
that a man of the name of Apra had stayed at
each of the hotels indicated to me by the bankers. He
also discovered that 'Apra' had with him a friend
named Dickinson who put down his birthplace as New
York. Do you follow me, Mrs. Winslow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I think so," she replied hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"At the first hotel, a small, comfortable, rather expensive
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;321]</span>
house in the Madeleine quarter, Fernando
Apra was a tall, dark, good-looking man, and the
other, the New Yorker, was fair and short. Though
on the best of terms they lived very different lives.
The American was out a great deal; he thoroughly
enjoyed the gay, lively sides of Paris life. Fernando
Apra on the other hand stayed indoors, reading and
writing a good deal. At last the two men left the
hotel, giving out that they were going to spend the
winter in the South of France. But they only stayed
a few days at Lyons and, doubling back to Paris, they
settled in the Latin Quarter on the other side of the
river.</p>

<p class="indent">"By that time, my dear Mrs. Winslow, <i>they had
exchanged identities</i>. The tall, dark man was now
Dickinson, and his fair friend had become Apra! It
was Apra who one day told the manager he was going
to a fancy dress ball and asked him to recommend
him a good theatrical costumier. When Lutin ran
that costumier to earth, the man at once remembered
the fact that a client he took to be an Englishman
had come and had had himself made up as a Mexican,
purchasing also two bottles of olive-coloured skin
stain. Now Apra was out all night after this extraordinary
transformation in his appearance had taken
place, but one of the waiters at the hotel recognised
him that same evening at Mabille. When the man
spoke to him, he appeared taken aback, and explained
that he had made a mistake in the day of the fancy
dress ball. The next morning he left the hotel, distributing
lavish tips to everybody. But Dickinson
stayed on for a few days, and during those days he received
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;322]</span>
each day a telegram from England. One of
these telegrams is actually in my possession."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty's host got up. He went across to a narrow,
upright piece of inlaid mahogany furniture, and unlocking
a drawer, took from it an envelope. Having
opened it, he handed Katty a blue strip of paper on
which were printed the words: "Concession going
well" and the signature "G."</p>

<p class="indent">Katty stared down at the bit of blue paper, and
she flushed. Even she realised the significance of
that "G."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think," said her host quietly, "that if you write
down from my dictation certain notes, and hand them,
<i>together with this telegram</i>, to the Commissioner of
Police, he may be trusted to do the rest."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;323]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="cap">FIVE quiet weeks slipped by&mdash;weeks full of outward,
as well as of inward, happiness at The
Chase and at Freshley.</p>

<p class="indent">Katty Winslow had come back to Rosedean, and
then, without even seeing Laura, had gone away again
almost at once. She was still away when there took
place early in December the gathering together, for
the first time for many years, of a big shooting party
at Knowlton Abbey.</p>

<p class="indent">Just before joining that pleasant party, Mrs. Pavely
spent a week in London, and certain Pewsbury gossips,
of whose very existence she was unaware, opined that
she had gone up to town to buy clothes! In a little
over a month, Godfrey Pavely would have been dead
a year, and some of these same gossips thought it
rather strange that Mrs. Pavely should be going to
stay at the Abbey before her first year of widowhood
was over. But the kinder of the busybodies reminded
one another that Lord St. Amant had known the mistress
of The Chase from childhood, and being, as he
was, a very good-natured man, no doubt he had
thought it would cheer up the poor lady to have a
little change.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Laura, to Mrs. Tropenell's surprise, had gone
up alone to London, and Oliver, after two days, followed
her. But he had not waited to escort her back,
as his mother expected him to do. He returned the
day before Laura&mdash;in fact she was away a week, he
only four days.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;324]</span>
The gossips of Pewsbury had been right. Laura
had gone up to town to get a few new clothes, but
she was still wearing unrelieved black, if not exactly
conventional widow's mourning, when she arrived at
Knowlton Abbey.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant's shooting party was a great success&mdash;a
success from the point of view of the
guests, and from that of the host. For the first time
for many years, in fact for the first time since the
death of Lady St. Amant, the house was quite full, for
in addition to the neighbours whom the host specially
wished to honour, there had come down certain more
sophisticated folk from London. Among others asked
had been Sir Angus Kinross; but Sir Angus, to his
own and Lord St. Amant's regret, had had to decline.
The two men had become intimate since last winter&mdash;each
had a real respect, a cordial liking, for the other.</p>

<p class="indent">The housekeeper at the Abbey had been surprised
to note his lordship's interest in every detail. He had
himself seen, and at considerable length, the <i>chef</i> who
had come down from London for the week; he had
even glanced over the bedroom list, making certain
suggestions as to where his various guests should sleep.
Thus it was by his desire that Mrs. Tropenell had
been given the largest bed-chamber in the house, one
which had never been, in the present housekeeper's
reign, occupied by a visitor. It had been, in the long,
long ago, the room of his mother, the room in fact
where his lordship himself had been born some seventy
odd years ago. By his wish, also, there had been
arranged for Mrs. Tropenell's occupation the old-fashioned
sitting-room into which the bedroom opened.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Oliver Tropenell had been put nearly opposite
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;325]</span>
Lord St. Amant's own sleeping apartment, in that portion
of the house which was known as "his lordship's
wing." And Mrs. Pavely had been given, in the same
part of the house, but at the further end of the corridor,
the room which had been always occupied, during
her infrequent sojourns at the Abbey, by the late Lady
St. Amant.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And now the long, though also the all too short,
week-end, which had lasted from Thursday to Tuesday,
was over, and all the guests had departed, with
the exception of Lord St. Amant's three intimate
friends&mdash;Mrs. Tropenell, that lady's son, and Mrs.
Pavely. This smaller party was staying on for two
more days, and then it would break up&mdash;Mrs. Tropenell
and Mrs. Pavely returning in the morning to
Freshley Manor and The Chase, while Mr. Tropenell
stayed on to accompany his host to another big shoot
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Though all three had professed sincere regret at
the departure of their fellow guests, each of them felt
a certain sense of relief, and yes, of more than relief,
of considerable satisfaction, when they found themselves
alone together.</p>

<p class="indent">There is always plenty to talk about after the breakup
of a country house party, and when at last the
four of them found themselves together at dinner,
they all did talk&mdash;even Laura, who was generally so
silent, talked and laughed, and exchanged quick, rather
shy jests with Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura and Oliver? Lord St. Amant had of course
very soon discovered their innocent secret. He had
taxed Mrs. Tropenell with the truth, and she had admitted
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;326]</span>
it, while explaining that they desired their engagement,
for obvious reasons, to remain secret for a
while.</p>

<p class="indent">During these last few days their host had admired,
with a touch of whimsical surprise, Laura's dignity,
and Oliver's self-restraint. Of course they had managed
to be a good deal together, aided by Lord St.
Amant's unobtrusive efforts, and owing to the fact
that Mrs. Tropenell's charming sitting-room upstairs
was always at their disposal.</p>

<p class="indent">But no one in the cheerful, light-hearted company
had come within miles of guessing the truth; and
Oliver Tropenell had done his full share in helping
Lord St. Amant in the entertainment of his guests.
He had also made himself duly agreeable to the ladies&mdash;indeed,
Oliver, in a sense, had been the success of
the party, partly because the way of his life in Mexico
enabled him to bring a larger, freer air into the discussions
which had taken place after dinner and in the
smoking-room, and also because of his vitality&mdash;a
vitality which just now burned with a brighter
glow....</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant and Oliver only stayed on at the
dining-table a very few minutes after Mrs. Tropenell
and Laura had gone off into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Though now on very cordial terms, the two men
never had very much to say to one another. Yet
Lord St. Amant had always been fond of Oliver. Being
the manner of man he was, he could not but feel
attached to Letty Tropenell's child. Still, there had
been a time, now many long years ago, just after the
death of his wife, when he had been acutely jealous
of Oliver&mdash;jealous, that is, of Mrs. Tropenell's absorption,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;327]</span>
love, and pride, in her son. She had made it so
very clear that she desired no closer tie to her old
friend&mdash;and this had shrewdly hurt his self-esteem.
But he had been too much of a philosopher to bear
<i>rancune</i>, and such a friendship as theirs soon became
had, after all, its compensations.</p>

<p class="indent">When Oliver settled in Mexico the time had passed
by for a renewal of the old relations, and for a while
the tie which had lasted for so long, and survived so
many secret vicissitudes, appeared to loosen....</p>

<p class="indent">But now, again, all that was changed. Lord St.
Amant had given up his wanderings on the Continent,
and he had come once more very near to Mrs. Tropenell,
during this last year. He and Oliver were also
better friends than they had ever been; this state of
things dated from last winter, for, oddly enough, what
had brought them in sympathy had been the death of
Godfrey Pavely. They had been constantly together
during the days which had followed the banker's mysterious
disappearance, and they had worked in close
union, each, in a sense, representing Laura, and having
a dual authority from her to do what seemed best.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, to-night, excellent as were the terms on which
each man felt with the other, neither had anything to
say that could not be said better in the company of
the ladies. And when in the drawing-room, which
now looked so large and empty with only two, where
last night there had been twelve, women gathered together
about the fireplace, the four talked on, pleasantly,
cheerfully, intimately, as they had done at dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while Laura and Oliver slipped away into
the smaller drawing-room, and Lord St. Amant and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;328]</span>
Mrs. Tropenell, hardly aware that the other two had
left them, went on gossiping&mdash;harking back, as they
now so often did, to the old stories, the old human
tragedies and comedies, of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after ten Laura and Oliver came back, walking
side by side, and Oliver's mother looked up with
a proud, fond glance.</p>

<p class="indent">They were a striking, well-matched couple&mdash;Laura
looking more beautiful than ever to-night, perhaps
because she seemed a thought more animated than
usual.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've come to say good-night," she exclaimed. "I
feel so sleepy! Oliver and I had such a glorious walk
this afternoon."</p>

<p class="indent">She bent down and kissed Mrs. Tropenell. And
then, unexpectedly, she turned to Lord St. Amant,
and put up her face as if she expected him also to
kiss her.</p>

<p class="indent">Amused and touched, he bent and brushed his old
lips against her soft cheek: "My dear," he exclaimed,
"this is very kind of you!"</p>

<p class="indent">And then Oliver stepped forward into the circle of
light thrown by the big wood fire.</p>

<p class="indent">He said a little huskily, "My turn next, Laura&mdash;&mdash;"
And to the infinite surprise of his mother and of his
host, Laura, with an impulsive, tender gesture, reached
up towards him, and he, too, brushed her soft face
with his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he took her hand, and led her to the door.
And Lord St. Amant, quoting Champml, turned to
his old love: "'Ah! Madame&mdash;quelle jolie chose qu'un
baiser!'" he murmured, and ere the door had quite
closed behind Oliver he, too, had put his arm with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;329]</span>
a caressing gesture round her shoulder, and drawn her
to him, with the whispered words, "Letty&mdash;don't think
me an old fool!" And then, "Oh, Letty! Do you
remember the first time&mdash;&mdash;" And though she made
no answer, he knew she did remember, like himself
only too well, the wild, winter afternoon, nearer forty
than thirty years ago, when they two had been caught
alone, far from home, in a great storm&mdash;the wild
weather responding to their wild mood. They had
taken shelter in a deserted, half-ruined barn, a survival
of the days when England had still great granaries.
And there, throwing everything aside&mdash;the insistent
promptings of honour, and the less insistent
promptings of prudence&mdash;St. Amant had kissed
Letty....</p>

<p class="indent">He remembered, even now, the thrill of mingled
rapture, shame, gratitude, triumph, and stinging self-rebuke,
which had accompanied that first long clinging
kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day he had left the Abbey for the Continent,
and when, at last, he had come back, he had
himself again well in hand....</p>

<p class="indent">Only yesterday the shooters had gone by that old
seventeenth-century barn, of which nothing now remained
but thick low walls, and as he had tramped
by the spot, so alone with his memories, if outwardly
so companioned, there had swept over his heart, that
heart which was still susceptible to every keen emotion,
a feeling of agonised regret for what had&mdash;and
what had not been.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Letty," he said huskily, "you've been the best
friend man ever had! Don't you think the time has
come for two such old friends as you and I have been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;330]</span>
never to part? It isn't as if I had a great deal of
time left."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">An hour later Lord St. Amant was sitting up in
bed, reading the fourth volume of a certain delightful
edition of the Memoirs of the Duc de Saint Simon.
He was feeling happier than he had felt for a very
long time&mdash;stirred and touched too, as he had not
thought to be again.</p>

<p class="indent">Complacently he reminded himself of the successful,
the brilliantly successful, elderly marriages he
had known in his time. 'Twas odd when one came to
think of it, but he couldn't remember one such which
had turned out a failure!</p>

<p class="indent">Dear Letty&mdash;who had known how to pass imperceptibly
from youth to age with such a fine, measured
dignity, while retaining so much which had made
her as a girl and as an older woman the most delightful
and stimulating of companions. What an agreeable
difference her presence would make to his existence
as he went slowly down into the shadows! He
shuddered a little&mdash;the thought of old age, of real old
age, becoming suddenly, vividly repugnant.</p>

<p class="indent">Thank God, Letty was very much younger than
himself. When he was eighty she would be sixty-three.
He tried to put away that thought, the thought
that some day he would be infirm, as well as old.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up from his book.</p>

<p class="indent">How odd to think that Letty had never been in this
room, where he had spent so much of his life from
boyhood onwards! He longed to show her some of
the things he had here&mdash;family miniatures, old political
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;331]</span>
caricatures, some of his favourite books&mdash;they
would all interest her.</p>

<p class="indent">He was glad he had arranged that she should have,
on this visit, his dear mother's room. When he had
married&mdash;close on fifty years ago&mdash;his parents had
been alive, and later his wife, as the new Lady St.
Amant, had not cared to take over her predecessor's
apartments. She had been very little here, for soon,
poor woman, she had become an invalid&mdash;a most disagreeable,
selfish invalid. He told himself that after
all he had had a certain amount of excuse for&mdash;well,
for the sort of existence he had led so long. If poor
Adelaide had only died twenty years earlier, and he
had married Letty&mdash;ah, <i>then</i>, he would indeed have
become an exemplary character! Yet he had been
faithful to Letty&mdash;in his fashion....</p>

<p class="indent">No other woman had even approached near the
sanctuary where the woman of whom now, to-night,
he was able to think as his future wife, had at once
become so securely enthroned. It had first been a
delicious, if a dangerous, relationship, and, later, a
most agreeable friendship. During the last few
months she had become rather to his surprise very
necessary to him, and these last few days he had
felt how pleasant it would be to have Letty always
here, at the Abbey, either in his company, or resting,
reading, or writing in the room where everything
still spoke to him of the long-dead mother who had
been so dear to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course they would wait till Oliver and Laura
were married&mdash;say, till some time in February or
March: and then, when those two rather tiresome
younger people were disposed of, they, he and Letty,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;332]</span>
would slip up quietly to London, and, in the presence
of perhaps two or three old friends, they would be
made man and wife.</p>

<p class="indent">He reflected complacently that nothing in his life
would be changed, save that Letty would be there, at
the Abbey, as she had been the last few days, always
ready to hear with eager interest anything he had to
say, always with her point of view sufficiently unlike
his own to give flavour, even sometimes a touch of
the unexpected, to their conversation.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A knock at the door, and his valet came in, and
walked close up to the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a telephone message, my lord. From Sir Angus
Kinross&mdash;private to your lordship."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. What is the message?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant felt a slight tremor of discomfort
sweep over him. What an odd time to send a trunk-call
through&mdash;at close on midnight.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir Angus has been trying to get on for some
time, my lord; there was a fault on the line. Sir
Angus would be much obliged if you would meet him
at your lordship's rooms at one o'clock to-morrow.
He says he's sorry to trouble your lordship to come
up to London, but it's very important. He came
himself to the telephone, my lord. He asked who
I was. I did offer to fetch your lordship, but he
said there was no occasion for that&mdash;if I would
deliver the message myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, Barrett."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir Angus begs your lordship not to tell any one
that your business to-morrow is with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I quite understand that."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;333]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="cap">"WE have solved the mystery of Godfrey Pavely's
death!"</p>

<p class="indent">Such were the words with which Sir Angus Kinross
greeted Lord St. Amant, when the latter, arriving at
his rooms, found the Commissioner of Police already
there.</p>

<p class="indent">"D'you mean that you've run Fernando Apra to
earth?"</p>

<p class="indent">The speaker felt relieved, and at the same time
rather discomfited. He had not associated the Commissioner
of Police's summons with that now half-forgotten,
painful story. Godfrey Pavely had vanished
out of his mind, as he had vanished out of every
one else's mind in the neighbourhood of Pewsbury,
and in the last few months when Sir Angus and Lord
St. Amant had met they had seldom alluded to the
strange occurrence which had first made them become
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, seeing that the other looked at him with
a singular look of hesitation, there came a slight feeling
of apprehension over St. Angus's host.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you actually got the man here, in England?
If so, I suppose poor Mrs. Pavely is bound to have a
certain amount of fresh trouble in connection with the
affair?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We have not got the man who called himself Fernando
Apra, and we are never likely to have him.
In fact, I regard it as certain that we shall not even
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;334]</span>
be able to connect him directly with the murder&mdash;for
murder it certainly was, St. Amant."</p>

<p class="indent">"Murder?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant repeated the word reluctantly,
doubtfully. He was beginning to feel more and more
apprehensive. There was something so strange and
so sombre in the glance with which the Commissioner
of Police accompanied his words.</p>

<p class="indent">During that fortnight when they had so constantly
seen one another last year, Sir Angus had never once
looked surprised, annoyed&mdash;or even put out! There
had been about him a certain imperturbability, both of
temper and of manner. He now looked infinitely
more disturbed than he had done even at the moment
when he had first seen Godfrey Pavely's dead body
sitting up in Fernando Apra's sinister-looking office.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he went on in a low, incisive voice, "it was
murder right enough! And we already hold a warrant,
which will be executed the day after to-morrow,
this next Friday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment, then uttered very deliberately
the words: "It is a warrant for the arrest of Mr.
Oliver Tropenell on the charge of having murdered
Mr. Godfrey Pavely on or about the 5th of last January."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I don't understand what you mean! Surely
Oliver Tropenell was not masquerading as Fernando
Apra?" exclaimed Lord St. Amant. "If one can believe
a mass of quite disinterested evidence, the two
men were utterly unlike!"</p>

<p class="indent">"That is so, and there was of course a man who
masqueraded, and masqueraded most successfully,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;335]</span>
both in Paris and in London, as Fernando Apra. That
man, St. Amant, was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant bent forward eagerly while his
mind, his still vigorous, intelligent, acute mind, darted
this way and that. What name&mdash;whose name&mdash;was
Sir Angus going to utter?</p>

<p class="indent">He was not long left in suspense.</p>

<p class="indent">"That man," said Sir Angus slowly, impressively,
"was Mrs. Pavely's brother, a certain Gilbert Baynton,
who is, we are informed, the business partner of
Mr. Tropenell in Mexico. It was <i>he</i> who masqueraded
as Fernando Apra. But it was not he who actually
fired the pistol shot which killed Godfrey Pavely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">When he had heard the name Gilbert Baynton, it
was as if a great light had suddenly burst in on Lord
St. Amant's brain. In spite of everything he felt a
sharp thrill of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good God!" he exclaimed. "There's been a terrible
mistake&mdash;but it's one that I can set right in a
very few minutes. Believe me, you're on the wrong
track altogether! If murder there was&mdash;murder, and
not manslaughter, which I venture to think much more
probable&mdash;then Gilbert Baynton was Godfrey Pavely's
murderer. The two men hated one another. It all
comes back to me&mdash;not only had they a quarrel years
ago, but that same quarrel was renewed not long before
Godfrey Pavely's disappearance. Nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>&mdash;would
induce me to believe that Oliver
Tropenell is a murderer!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm afraid you'll soon be brought round to believe
it," said Sir Angus ruefully. "I am of course well
aware of what you say concerning Gilbert Baynton's
relations to his brother-in-law. We've already found
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;336]</span>
all that out, especially as we had a willing witness close
to our hand. Unfortunately&mdash;I say unfortunately, St.
Amant, for of course I know he is a thorough bad
hat&mdash;we have irrefutable evidence that this man
Baynton did <i>not</i> commit the murder. He was certainly
in Paris at the time when Godfrey Pavely was
killed in London."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus took a turn up and down the room&mdash;then
he came back to where the other man was sitting.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can take it from me, St. Amant, that there
has never been, in the whole history of criminal jurisprudence,
so far as I am acquainted with it, any crime
planned out with such infinite care, ingenuity, and&mdash;and&mdash;well,
yes, I must say it, a kind of almost diabolical
cunning. So true is that that&mdash;&mdash;" He took
another turn up and down the room, and then once
more he came and stood before his friend: "Well, I
consider the murderer has a very good sporting chance
of getting off&mdash;scot free! He will be able to command
the best legal advice as well as the best intellects at the
Criminal Bar&mdash;that he himself has no mean intellect
he has proved over this business. Yes, I shouldn't be
in the least surprised if he managed to scrape through!
More fortunate than most of his kind, he has a new
country to which he will be able to retire with the
widow of the man he murdered&mdash;if she can be brought
to believe in him. And, mind you, women can be
brought to believe <i>anything</i> of those they love, or at
any rate, they can be brought to <i>seem</i> to believe anything!"</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment, and then added abruptly, "I
formed the opinion that Mrs. Pavely was a very unusual
woman, St. Amant."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;337]</span>
"But you don't think&mdash;surely you don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no&mdash;&mdash;" Sir Angus was very decided. "I
certainly don't think Mrs. Pavely was in any way
concerned in this appalling plot. And mind you&mdash;ill
as I think of him, I must admit that Oliver Tropenell's
a brave man. He did the job himself&mdash;even if he was
helped by his friend."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment. Somehow St. Amant was
taking the news far more to heart than he had expected.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll tell you everything in time, but it's a long,
complicated story; and of course I'm trusting entirely
to your honour in the matter. What I tell you now
must never go beyond these four walls."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus sat down, and Lord St. Amant listened,
half of his brain acutely, sensitively alive to the story
that was being told him&mdash;the other half in a kind of
stupor of grief, of shame, and of horror. That second
half of his brain was dominated by one name, one
thought, one heart-beat&mdash;Letty, the dear, the beloved
woman who had just promised to marry him, to bring
him the solace of her care and companionship in the
evening of his days....</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Apart from certain most cleverly devised breaks
in the story&mdash;to which I shall make allusion presently&mdash;Oliver
Tropenell's best chance lies in the absence of
adequate motive. Why should this millionaire wish
to murder a man who, as he will easily be able to
prove, was not only an intimate friend, but also a connection
of his own? Our answer to that question will
be to put in these two anonymous letters."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus took out of his pocket the two letters
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;338]</span>
which had caused poor Godfrey Pavely such acute
discomfort just a year before.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant read them through, carefully, in
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, as I daresay you know, judges look very
much askance at anonymous letters, and especially in
a trial for murder. Also these prove so <i>very</i> little&mdash;the
more so that there seems to have been no talk at
all about Tropenell and Mrs. Pavely in the neighbourhood.
She bears, and has always borne, a very high
character. As for these letters, they were evidently
written by a woman&mdash;and by an educated woman.
Any one familiar with disguised handwriting could
tell you <i>that</i> much. Of course I have my own theory
as to who wrote them."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant nodded. "Yes, so have I."</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, I'm not bound to give my theory to either
side, am I? I foresee that very probably these letters
will remain anonymous. A great many people who
think themselves clever will put them down to some
dismissed servant.</p>

<p class="indent">"The fact that Mr. Tropenell left England for
Mexico so soon after the discovery of Mr. Pavely's
body is a good point on his side. The judge will
argue, above all the jury will argue, that if he had
been in love with Mrs. Pavely&mdash;if he had loved her,
that is, with a guilty passion&mdash;he would not have left
her just after she had become a widow. Nothing compelled
him to do so. It has been suggested, but from
a person who does not intend to go into the
witness-box if she can help it, that Tropenell and Mrs. Pavely
are now secretly engaged. My answer to that is&mdash;why
shouldn't they be? Many a man has married his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;339]</span>
best friend's widow without any one supposing that
he committed murder in order to attain that satisfaction!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you proof&mdash;irrefutable proof&mdash;pointing to
the guilt of Oliver Tropenell?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What is irrefutable proof? It can be proved that
Oliver Tropenell spent many weeks on the Continent
in the company of the man who undoubtedly masqueraded
as Fernando Apra, and that for a certain portion
of that time the two men exchanged identities.
Nothing can shake that portion of the evidence. But
there is no record of the two having met, later, in
London&mdash;I mean during the time when the net was
certainly being drawn round Godfrey Pavely. And, as
I said before, Gilbert Baynton&mdash;<i>alias</i> Fernando Apra&mdash;has
an absolute alibi. He was certainly in Paris on
the day when all trace of Pavely was lost. There
seems no doubt at all that the evidence of the London
hotel manager was most artfully arranged for. The
man's story was given in good faith, but the incident
occurred a full week before Mr. Pavely was done to
death."</p>

<p class="indent">"But where does Tropenell come in?"</p>

<p class="indent">"As to the movements of Mr. Oliver Tropenell,
we have not been quite so fortunate in tracing them.
But even so, we have evidence that during the fateful
three days on one of which the murder was certainly
committed, he was staying in London, having
just arrived from the Continent. I personally have
no doubt at all that it was on Thursday, January
the 5th, that, lured by a cleverly concocted letter signed
'Fernando Apra,' the hapless Pavely went to Duke
House to find Tropenell lying in wait for him. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;340]</span>
two men may have had words&mdash;they probably <i>did</i> have
words. But whatever passed&mdash;and look at it as you
may, St. Amant&mdash;it was deliberate murder."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant stood up. His turn had come to
astound the Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said, "yes, if your theory is correct,
Kinross, it was deliberate murder&mdash;to me far the more
terrible fact, because the murderer will soon be my
stepson. I am to be married to Mrs. Tropenell by
special licence next week."</p>

<p class="indent">And as the Commissioner of Police, transfixed with
surprise, remained silent, the other went on, speaking
rather quietly and coldly, "It is only fair on my part
to tell you this. Indeed, perhaps I ought to have told
you at once&mdash;I mean when I first gathered the purport
of what you wished to say to me."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus shook his head. He was filled with a
great pity, as well as a great admiration, for the man&mdash;who
now looked such an old man&mdash;standing there
facing him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here," he said slowly. "I oughtn't perhaps
to make such a suggestion to you&mdash;but we've become
friends, St. Amant. That is why I venture to advise
you that before this next Friday you should get these
two unfortunate ladies, Mrs. Tropenell and Mrs.
Pavely, out of the country. Take them away&mdash;hide
them away&mdash;in France or in Spain! If you do that
they will be spared a fathomless measure of anguish
and of shame. The presence of neither of them is essential
to the course of justice, and if they remain in
England they will certainly each be called as witnesses,
in which case Mrs. Pavely will go through&mdash;well, I
can only describe it as <i>hell</i>. It is not as if the presence
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;341]</span>
of either of them would be really beneficial to Oliver
Tropenell."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can you say that quite truly about his mother?"
asked Lord St. Amant searchingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus looked up with a very troubled expression
of face.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I fear I can't," he answered, frankly, "for if
Mrs. Tropenell can bring herself to believe her son
absolutely innocent, then, in the hands of a skilful
counsel, I have to admit that her evidence might be
of great sentimental value to Tropenell. But the same
cannot be said of Mrs. Pavely's presence in the witness-box.
Whichever way you look at it, Mrs. Pavely's
presence is bound to be, in a judicial sense, detrimental
to the man in the dock. She is, if I may say
so, St. Amant, a singularly attractive woman, and ten
out of every twelve of the men in Court would probably
regard her as providing a very adequate 'motive'!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause, and then Sir Angus began
again:</p>

<p class="indent">"What would you say to our persuading Mrs.
Pavely to leave England for a while, leaving only
Mrs. Tropenell to face the music?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Pavely," said Lord St. Amant thoughtfully,
"would probably refuse to leave England. I think,
I fear, that she loves Oliver Tropenell&mdash;passionately."</p>

<p class="indent">He added abruptly, "Are you having him watched?"</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Angus cleared his throat. "Well, no, not exactly
<i>watched</i>. We are of course aware that he has
been staying with you for the past week, and that he
is going back to Freshley Manor&mdash;is it to-morrow,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;342]</span>
or the day after to-morrow? I take it that he would
probably prefer to be arrested in his mother's house."</p>

<p class="indent">A feeling of sick horror came over the other man's
heart. "I&mdash;I suppose so," he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Sir Angus Kinross dropped his voice:
"You really know this man and I don't. Do you
think it advisable that he should be prepared for what
is coming&mdash;that <i>you</i>, for instance, St. Amant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean," exclaimed Lord St. Amant, "that
I may&mdash;warn him?"</p>

<p class="indent">The other nodded. "Yes, that is what I suggest
that you should do. I take it that we can be quite
sure that he will do nothing mad or foolish&mdash;that
he will not try to get away, for instance? It would
be quite useless, and I need hardly point out that it
would ruin his chances&mdash;later. I think you are at
liberty to tell him, as from yourself of course, that
you have reason to think he has a sporting chance,
St. Amant. But I am trusting, not only to your honour,
but to your secrecy and&mdash;and discretion."</p>

<p class="indent">The other nodded gravely. "Tropenell's not the
sort of man to run away."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I don't think he is&mdash;once he knows the game
is up," answered the Commissioner of Police a trifle
grimly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;343]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="cap">IT was now early, very early in the morning after
the return of Lord St. Amant to the Abbey.
Dead dark, and dead quiet too, in the great sleeping
house. Not dead cold, however, in his lordship's
comfortable bedroom, for he had built up the fire,
as he sat on and on, still fully dressed, reading, or
trying to read&mdash;his bed exactly in the same state as
when he had gone upstairs from the drawing-room
about eleven.</p>

<p class="indent">It was years and years since Lord St. Amant had
last stayed up all night, but though he had made a
great effort to forget himself in those ever fresh, even
if familiar, memoirs of Saint Simon, he had found it
impossible to banish from his mind&mdash;even for a few
moments&mdash;the awful thing which he knew would, in
a sense, never leave his mind again.</p>

<p class="indent">For the tenth time he put his book down, marking
the page with a tiny strip of green watered ribbon,
on a low table by his side, and then, staring into the
fire, his memory lingered&mdash;not over his talk with Sir
Angus Kinross, he was sick of thinking <i>that</i> over&mdash;but
over the incidents which had marked the evening
before.</p>

<p class="indent">He had returned from London only just in time to
dress for dinner, and so he had not seen his guests
till just before a quarter-past eight. Then had followed
an hour passed, outwardly at least, peacefully
and pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;344]</span>
But while he had been eating mechanically the food
put before him, in very truth not knowing what it
was, terrible thoughts had gone through his mind in a
terrible sequence.</p>

<p class="indent">Once or twice he had caught, or thought he had
caught, Oliver Tropenell's penetrating eyes fixed
searchingly on his face, but he, the host, had avoided
looking at his guest. Somehow he could neither look
at Oliver, nor even think of Oliver&mdash;with Oliver and
Laura there, the one sitting opposite to him, the other
next him.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura? Laura, on Lord St. Amant's left, had
looked lovely last night. She was wearing a white
dress, almost bridal in its dead whiteness&mdash;a rather
singular fact considering that she had till to-day worn
unrelieved black. Looking back, her host could not
get her out of his mind. To think that she, proud,
reserved, Laura Pavely was to be the heroine of a
frightful tragedy which would bring not only shame
and disgrace on herself and on the man whom Lord
St. Amant had every reason to suppose she now loved,
but&mdash;what was of so very much more concern to him&mdash;on
that man's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking at Laura, seeing that strange, haunting
Mona Lisa smile on her lovely face, it had seemed
incredible that she should be the central figure of such
a story. But how could she escape being the central
figure, the heroine of the story, at any rate in the
imagination of all those, one might almost count them
by millions, rather than thousands, who in a few days
or a few weeks would be as familiar with the name
"Mrs. Pavely" as they once had been with the names
of&mdash;of Mrs. Bravo and Mrs. Maybrick?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;345]</span>
Yes, Lord St. Amant, staring into the fire, told
himself, that that three-quarters of an hour spent in
his own dining-room had been the most painful time
he had ever lived through in his long life. He felt
as if every moment of it was indelibly stamped on his
brain. And yet he had completely forgotten what the
talk had been about! He supposed they had talked.
Silence would have seemed so strange, so unnatural.
Yet he could not remember a single thing which had
been said.</p>

<p class="indent">But his vision of the three who had sat at table
with him remained horribly clear.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he was haunted specially by Oliver. And
then, after a while, Oliver left him, and he was
haunted by his poor friend, soon to be his poor wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell had been more silent than usual&mdash;so
much he did remember. And he wondered uneasily
if he had given her any cause for thinking, from
his appearance or his manner, that there was anything
wrong?</p>

<p class="indent">The thought of what was going to happen to Mrs.
Tropenell on the day which was now to-morrow, became
suddenly so intolerable to Lord St. Amant that
he got up from his chair, and walked twice round the
large, shadowed bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he sat down again, and groaned aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">It was as though a bridge had been thrown over
the chasm of nearly forty years. His withered heart
became vivified. Something of the passion which he
had left for the high-spirited and innocent, yet ardent-natured,
girl whom he had loved, and whom he had
saved from herself, stirred within him. Secretly,
voicelessly, he had always been very proud of what
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;346]</span>
he had, done&mdash;and left undone. It was the one good,
nay, the one selfless, action of his long, agreeable,
selfish life.</p>

<p class="indent">But he could not save her now! Some little shelter
and protection he would be able to afford her, but
what would it avail against the frightful cloud of
shame and anguish which was about to envelop her?</p>

<p class="indent">He told himself suddenly what he had already told
himself when with Sir Angus&mdash;namely, that he and
Letty must be married at once. She would certainly
acquiesce in any course which would benefit Oliver.
Yes, Letty would think of nothing but her son, and,
the world being what it is, Oliver would of course
benefit by the fact that Lord St. Amant was his stepfather.
It would add yet another touch of the unusual
and the romantic to the story....</p>

<p class="indent">Once more his mind swung back to last evening.
He and Oliver had stayed alone together some ten
minutes after the ladies had gone into the drawing-room,
and there had come over Lord St. Amant a
wild, unreasoning impulse to unburden his heart. But
of course he had checked, battened down resolutely,
that foolish almost crazy impulse. As soon as Letty
and Laura were safely gone tomorrow morning he
must, of course, tackle the terrible task. And then he
tried, as he had tried so often during the last twelve
hours, to put himself in Oliver Tropenell's place.</p>

<p class="indent">He recalled the younger man's easy, assured manner,
and what a real help, nay, more than help, he
had been when the house was full of guests. More
than one of their neighbours there had spoken warmly,
with evident admiration, of Tropenell. "How well
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;347]</span>
he's turned out! He was thought to be such a queer
chap as a boy."</p>

<p class="indent">A queer chap? Oliver was certainly <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant forced himself to consider the man
whom his intellect, if not his heart, was compelled
to recognise as a cold-blooded murderer.</p>

<p class="indent">What had been his and Laura's real attitude to one
another during Godfrey Pavely's lifetime? Was
Laura absolutely innocent? Or, had she played with
Tropenell as women sometimes do play with men&mdash;as
a certain kind of beautiful, graceful, dignified cat
sometimes plays with a mouse? He was still inclined
to think <i>not</i>,&mdash;before yesterday he would certainly
have said not. But one never can tell&mdash;with a
woman....</p>

<p class="indent">And what was going to happen now? Oliver had
always been a fighter&mdash;no doubt Oliver would be prepared
to take the "sporting chance."</p>

<p class="indent">When he and his guest had gone into the drawing-room
last evening, Laura and Oliver had almost at
once passed through into the smaller drawing-room.
They had moved away unconcernedly, as if it was
quite natural that they should desire to be by themselves,
rather than in the company of Oliver's mother
and Laura's host; and Lord St. Amant, looking furtively
at Mrs. Tropenell, had felt a sudden painful
constriction of the heart as he had noted the wistful
glance she had cast on the two younger people. It
had been such a touching look&mdash;the look of the mother
who gives up her beloved to the woman who has become
his beloved.</p>

<p class="indent">At ten o'clock tea had been brought in&mdash;an old-fashioned
habit which was, perhaps, the only survival
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;348]</span>
of the late Lady St. Amant's reign at the Abbey, and,
to the surprise of Mrs. Tropenell, her companion had
poured himself out a cup and had drunk it off absently.</p>

<p class="indent">She had smiled, exclaiming, "You shouldn't have
done that! You know you never can take tea and
coffee so near together!" And he had said, "Can't
I? No, of course I can't. How stupid of me!"</p>

<p class="indent">And Laura, hearing the opening and the shutting
of doors, had come back, and said that she felt sleepy.
They had had another glorious walk, she and Oliver....</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, that had been how the evening had worn itself
out, so quiet and pleasant, so peaceful&mdash;outwardly.
It was, indeed, outwardly just the kind of
evening which Lord St. Amant had promised himself
only yesterday should be repeated many times, after
his marriage to his old friend. But now he knew that
that had been the last apparently pleasant, peaceful
evening that was ever likely to fall to his share in this
life. Even if Oliver Tropenell, aided by his great
wealth and shrewd intellect, escaped the legal consequences
of his wicked deed, his mother would ever
be haunted by the past&mdash;if indeed the fiery ordeal did
not actually kill her.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man, sitting by the fire, began to feel very,
very tired&mdash;tired, yet excited, and not in the least
sleepy. He turned and looked over at his bed, and
then he shook his head. Yet he would have to get into
that bed and pretend that he had slept in it, before
his valet came into the room at half-past seven.</p>

<p class="indent">It was years, years, <i>years</i> since he had last tried
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;349]</span>
to make an unslept-in bed look as if it had been slept
in.</p>

<p class="indent">He told himself fretfully that it was odd how unwilling
he felt to go over in his own mind the amazing
story told him by Sir Angus Kinross. He had
thought of nothing else on his long journey from
London, but since he had arrived at the Abbey, since
he had seen Oliver, he could not bear to think over
the details of the sinister story. He forced himself
to glance at them, as it were obliquely, for a moment.
Yes, he could quite see what Sir Angus meant! Oliver
certainly had a sporting chance, backed with the power
of commanding the best legal advice and the highest
talent at the Bar, coupled with the kind of sympathy
which is aroused, even in phlegmatic England, by
what the French call a <i>crime passionel</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Once more Lord St. Amant took up the little faded
red leather-bound volume, but he had hardly pushed
aside the green ribbon which marked his place in it,
when there struck on his ears the metallic sound of
an alarum clock&mdash;one which he judged to have been
carefully muffled and deadened, yet which must be
quite sufficiently audible to fulfil its purpose of awakening
any sleeper in the room where it happened to
be.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, on hearing that sound, Lord St. Amant was
exceedingly surprised, for, as far as he knew, only
one other room was occupied on this side of the corridor.
That room was that which his late wife had
chosen in preference to the one which had been his
mother's, and by an odd whim he had assigned it to
Laura Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;350]</span>
He turned slightly round in his chair, and glanced
at the travelling clock which was on his dressing-table.</p>

<p class="indent">It was half-past five.</p>

<p class="indent">Why should Laura, or any one else in that great
house for the matter of that, wish to be awakened on
a winter's morning at such an hour?</p>

<p class="indent">While he was thinking this over, he heard the sound
of a key turning quietly in a lock, and then there came
that of the slow opening of a door on to the corridor.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood up, uncertain what to do, and feeling his
nerves taut.</p>

<p class="indent">Though he was now an old man, his limbs had
not lost all their suppleness, and after a moment of
hesitation he sprang to his door and opened it.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes! He could hear the firm tread of footsteps
coming down the corridor towards him, to his left.</p>

<p class="indent">He flung his door wide open, and into the stream
of light thrown by his powerful reading lamp into
the corridor, there suddenly appeared Oliver
Tropenell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">For a flashing moment the tall figure loomed out of
the darkness, and then was engulfed again....</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant shut the door and hurried back to
the fireplace. He cursed the impulse, bred half of
genuine alarm, half of eager curiosity, which had
made him the unwilling sharer in another man's&mdash;and
woman's&mdash;secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Laura? Laura?&mdash;<i>Laura?</i> He was so taken aback,
so surprised, so utterly astounded, and yes, so shocked,
that for a moment he forgot the terrible thing which
had now filled his mind without ceasing for so many
hours. Then it came back, a thousand-fold more
vivid and accusing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;351]</span>
Laura? Good God, how mistaken he had been in
her! Manlike, he told himself, most unfairly, that
somehow what he had now learnt made everything&mdash;anything
possible.</p>

<p class="indent">But before he had time to sit down, the door opened
again, and Oliver Tropenell walked into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish you to know," he began, without any preamble,
"that Laura and I were married a week ago
in London. She wished to wait&mdash;in fact it had been
arranged that we should wait&mdash;till February or March.
But to please me&mdash;only to please me, St. Amant&mdash;she
put her own wishes, her own scruples aside. If there
is any blame&mdash;the blame is entirely, <i>entirely</i> mine."
He waited a moment, and then went on rapidly:</p>

<p class="indent">"As far as the rest of the world&mdash;the indifferent
world&mdash;is concerned, it will believe that Laura and I
were married when of course we should have been,
after Godfrey Pavely had been dead a year. But
Laura would like my mother to know. In fact she
intends, I believe, to tell my mother to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant found himself debating, with a
kind of terrible self-questioning, whether now was
the moment to speak to Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I understand," he said shakily. "And
I think Laura did quite right. But even so I suggest
that nothing is said to your mother&mdash;yet. I have a
very serious reason for asking you to beg Laura to
keep your marriage absolutely secret."</p>

<p class="indent">He was looking earnestly, painfully into the face
of the younger man.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver Tropenell's countenance suddenly stiffened.
It assumed a terrible, mask-like expression.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had your journey to London," he asked slowly,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;352]</span>
"anything to do with my affairs? I thought so once&mdash;at
dinner. Did Sir Angus Kinross send for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord St. Amant could not, did not, speak. But at
last he bent his head.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Oliver asked another question, quickly, in a
matter-of-fact tone: "How many hours have I left?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Till to-morrow, I mean till Friday, morning," the
other answered in a stifled voice.</p>

<p class="indent">He longed to go on, to tell the man standing by
his side what Sir Angus had said as to his having "a
sporting chance." But there was something in the
expression of the rigid, mask-like face which forbade
his saying that.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Oliver Tropenell turned round and
grasped his host's hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I owe you a lot of kindness," he muttered. "I
used not to be grateful, but I am grateful, <i>now</i>. We'll
get Laura and mother off&mdash;and then you'll tell me
what I have to know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;353]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="cap">MRS. TROPENELL stood by the window of the
pretty, old-fashioned sitting-room which she
had now occupied for over a week, and which she
knew would be, in a special sense, her own room, after
she had became Lady St. Amant.</p>

<p class="indent">She was already dressed for the drive home with
Laura Pavely. It was nearly twelve o'clock, and the
car would be round in a few minutes. But she was
waiting on, up here, for her son, for after breakfast
Oliver had said casually: "I'll come up to your room
for a moment, mother&mdash;I mean before you start for
Freshley."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked round the room consideringly. Nothing
in it had been altered for something like fifty
years. Above the Italian marble chimney-piece was
a good portrait, in oils, of Lord St. Amant's father,
and on either side of the fireplace were crayon drawings
of St. Amant as a little boy, and of his two sisters
as little girls. Everything here epitomised the
placid, happy life of the good and fortunate woman
who had been Lord St. Amant's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">But the pretty, old-fashioned, peaceful-looking room
told also of the strange transience of human life.
With the exception of that early Victorian crayon
drawing of the stalwart little boy, almost everything
in the nature of a relic or memento spoke of some
human being long dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tropenell felt curiously at peace. There was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;354]</span>
something almost final about the feeling which possessed
her. Up to last night she had been anxious,
restless, full of a secret, painful doubt as to whether
she was doing right in marrying Lord St. Amant.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, this morning, her doubts had gone, partly
owing to a very trifling thing, a quick perception of
how well St. Amant and Oliver got on together&mdash;now.
She had been alone with them at breakfast, and they
had talked eagerly together, passing quickly from one
subject to another, with no intervals of silence. When,
at last, Oliver had got up, St. Amant also had risen,
and put his arm with an affectionate gesture round the
younger man's shoulder, and she had caught a strange
look, a look of moved gratitude, on Oliver's dark
face....</p>

<p class="indent">She had dreaded telling her son of her resolve&mdash;but
the dread had left her, and she made up her
mind to tell him this morning&mdash;not to wait, as she
had half thought of doing, till he was at home again.</p>

<p class="indent">St. Amant and Oliver were going to shoot this
afternoon over land belonging to little Alice Pavely.
Laura had let The Chase shooting to a neighbour,
and the neighbour, whose name was Buckhurst, had
invited the other two to join his shooting party to-day,
and to-morrow also. Oliver was coming home
to Freshley in between....</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened. "Mother, may I come in?"</p>

<p class="indent">She turned quickly, all her heart, as always, welcoming
him. With a little, unacknowledged pang
she told herself that Oliver was growing older, that
he was losing the look of buoyancy that he had kept
so long. But what a fine, strong, vigorous-looking
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;355]</span>
man he looked!&mdash;as he stood there, smiling rather
gravely at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver?" she exclaimed, suddenly making up her
mind to rush her fence&mdash;it was a simile which still
often occurred to her&mdash;"Oliver, my dear, I want to
tell you something. I have promised Lord St. Amant
to marry him."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked moved and surprised&mdash;perhaps more
than she had expected him to be. But his answer
came instantly: "I am glad, mother. I'm very, very
glad! I want to tell you, I've meant to tell you for
some time, that I felt I've been very churlish in this
matter of Lord St. Amant. He's always been good
to me! Very, very good. I owed him a great deal as
a boy. Lately, well, mother, you must have noticed
it yourself, we've become really friends."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked swiftly round the pretty room. Till
this morning he had always been here alone with
Laura, having eyes only for her. He saw now what
a charming room it was&mdash;so warm, so cosy too, on this
chilly, wintry December day.</p>

<p class="indent">He exclaimed: "It will be good to think of you
here&mdash;wherever I may be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She felt a tremor go through her. Somehow she
had thought that he meant to settle down in England;
he had never said anything about it, but she had
thought that that was his intention.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is Laura willing to spend a part of every year in
Mexico, my dearest?"</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded, rather absently, as if the question
hardly required an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">She moved closer to him. "You are very happy,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;356]</span>
are you not, Oliver?" she asked in a low voice, and
looking up into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">And again he answered at once, almost as though
he had seen the question in her eyes before she uttered
it: "Very, very happy, mother! I don't suppose
any man has ever been happier than I have been."</p>

<p class="indent">Again she put an intimate, probing question, wondering
at her own courage, her own temerity, in doing so.
"Laura wholly satisfies you?" she asked, allowing
nothing of the doubt which was still in her
heart to creep into her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wholly," he said, again in that strong, confident
voice. "And, mother&mdash;?" he waited a moment, and
then, in a voice suddenly tense with emotion, he
muttered&mdash;"what she is to me, I, all unworthy though I
be, am to her. Do you know what&mdash;what response
means to a man?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I do," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">They remained silent. She felt as if she were, for
the first time, fused in intense spiritual communion
with her son.</p>

<p class="indent">He broke the spell. "There's something I want
you to know," he said. And then he stopped short,
and, looking away, exclaimed, "Laura shall tell you!"
The carriage gong echoed through the great house.
He opened the door, she passed through it, and so together
they walked down to the large, rather bare
hall. There they waited a few moments in silence,
till there came the sound of light footsteps&mdash;Laura
running downstairs, a small fur cap on her beautiful
head.</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried towards them, smiling, and Mrs. Tropenell
turned away&mdash;a twinge of jealous pain, of which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;357]</span>
she was ashamed, in her heart&mdash;and stared into the
big log fire.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard Oliver exclaim, in accents at once imploring
and imperious: "Laura? Come over here a
moment."</p>

<p class="indent">At last she, the mother, turned slowly round, to
see, through the half-open door of Lord St. Amant's
study, the two standing together, locked in each other's
arms, Laura looking up into Oliver's face with an
expression of rapt devotion, of entire absorption, in
her blue, heavy-lidded eyes. As their lips met, Mrs.
Tropenell looked quickly away. She asked herself if
this exalted passion could last, and whether, after all,
Oliver were not happier now than he could ever hope
to be again?</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was very silent during the first half of their
homeward drive, but at last she amazed Mrs. Tropenell
by suddenly saying: "I want you to know&mdash;I
feel I must tell you&mdash;that Oliver and I were married,
in London, ten days ago. And I think&mdash;oh, Aunt
Letty, I do think that he is happy&mdash;at last!"</p>

<p class="indent">She said the words very simply, and Mrs. Tropenell
felt extraordinarily moved. This then was what
Oliver had wanted her to know, and man-like had
felt too&mdash;too shy to tell her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am very grateful to you for what you have
done," she exclaimed, and held the younger woman's
hand tightly clasped in hers for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">That was all. But before they parted Laura gave
his mother a message from Oliver. It was quite an
unimportant message, simply that on his way home he
meant to look in at The Chase.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;358]</span>
"You don't mind, do you?" Laura asked, a little
hesitatingly. And Oliver's mother smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course not, my dear&mdash;I'm glad he should!
Perhaps you'd like to come back with him, and stay
on for dinner?"</p>

<p class="indent">But Laura, reddening with one of her rather rare,
vivid blushes, shook her head. "I think I ought to
stay at home the first evening," she said, "and put
Alice to bed. She loves my putting her to bed. I
don't want Alice ever to feel jealous."</p>

<p class="indent">But this time Mrs. Tropenell made no answer. Poor
little Alice! It would be strange indeed if the child
did not feel a little jealous as time went on&mdash;if, that
is, Laura went on being, as she seemed to be, almost
mystically absorbed in this wonderful, glowing thing
which had come into her life.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was the afternoon of the same day, and Mrs.
Tropenell, after dealing with the various matters
which had accumulated during her week's absence,
had gone up to her room to rest before Oliver's return.
Lying on her bed, in the fast-gathering twilight,
thinking over all that had happened, and all
that was happening, to herself and to those she loved,
Mrs. Tropenell dozed off for a few moments. Then,
in a long flash which seemed to contain ons of sensation,
she went through an amazing and terrifying experience!</p>

<p class="indent">On the dead stillness which reigned both within
and without the house there suddenly rang out a
shot. At the same moment, if not indeed before, her
whole being seemed to be bracing itself up to endure
a great ordeal. It was as if her spirit, vanquishing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;359]</span>
a base, secret, physical terror of the unknown, was
about to engage on a great adventure.</p>

<p class="indent">With a stifled cry she sat up, and then she realised,
with a gasp of relief, that she had been dreaming,
only dreaming&mdash;but her heart went on beating for a
long time with the excitement, the mingled terror and
exaltation of spirit, she had just gone through.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, feeling curiously languid and shaken, she
went downstairs, and had tea in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only a little after five; probably Oliver would
not come in till just before it was time to dress for
dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">The stillness of the house oppressed her. She got
up, and moved restlessly about the room. The curtains
had been drawn and the fire made up while she
had been upstairs. She went across to one of the
windows, and, behind the closed curtains, opened it
widely. And as she opened the window, and stood
by it, breathing in the cold, moist air, she heard the
sound of branches being pushed aside across a little-used
path which was even a shorter cut to The Chase
than was the beech-wood avenue.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Oliver was coming home earlier than Laura
had thought he would?</p>

<p class="indent">She stepped out quickly into the open air, on to the
flagged path.</p>

<p class="indent">She could hear quick footsteps now&mdash;but they were
not Oliver's footsteps. It was probably a maid coming
back from the village which lay beyond The Chase.
But even so there crept a slight feeling of anxiety
over her heart. "Who's there?" she called out.</p>

<p class="indent">Close out of the twilit darkness there came the instant
hoarse answer: "It's Laura, Aunt Letty."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;360]</span>
"Laura? Oh, my dear, you'll catch cold!" for
Laura, without hat or cloak, was now there, before
her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aunt Letty? I've brought bad news&mdash;there's been
an accident."</p>

<p class="indent">"To Oliver?" But she knew, even as she asked the
question, what the answer would be.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;Oliver. They went on too long in the twilight&mdash;he
stumbled, and his gun went off. They're
bringing him home&mdash;now."</p>

<p class="indent">Laura was staring before her, her eyes veiled,
glassy, like those of a blind woman.</p>

<p class="indent">"They wanted to bring him to The Chase. But
there was a doctor there, and he said nothing would
be of any use. So I told them to bring him home&mdash;to
you."</p>

<p class="indent">Both women waited in the grateful darkness, dry-eyed
and still.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Mrs. Tropenell said uncertainly: "Come indoors,
Laura."</p>

<p class="indent">But Laura shook her head. "No, I'd rather stay out
here, if you don't mind, Aunt Letty."</p>

<p class="indent">Not quite knowing what she was doing or why,
Mrs. Tropenell walked forward and opened the door
into the hall. There she took down a cloak, and
coming out again, she put it round Laura. And they
stood there waiting&mdash;till there broke on their ears
the heavy tramp of men's feet carrying a burden.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;361]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="cap">IT was arranged between Lord St. Amant and the
coroner&mdash;who was his lordship's own medical attendant
(when he required a medical attendant, which
was seldom)&mdash;that the inquest should be held at
Freshley Manor.</p>

<p class="indent">The body had been placed in Mrs. Tropenell's own
room, that is, in the very room, as the cook, who had
been in the house close on thirty-five years, explained
to some of the members of the jury, where poor Mr.
Oliver had been born.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was there, in that peaceful, old-fashioned,
lady's bedchamber, that the twelve good men and true
of Pewsbury had to view the body. It was remembered
afterwards that the expression on the dead man's
face showed how completely he had been taken by
surprise: it bore an expression of absolute serenity&mdash;almost
as if he had died in his sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Rather to the disapproval of some of the Pewsbury
people, but with the sympathetic understanding of
others, Mrs. Tropenell, by her own desire, was present
at the inquest; and, supporting her on the painful
occasion, was her nearest neighbour and almost daughter,
Mrs. Pavely.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief witness was Mr. Robert Buckhurst, the
gentleman who had been host to the ill-fated shooting
party.</p>

<p class="indent">His evidence was quite simple and straightforward&mdash;indeed,
there was nothing at all strange or mysterious
about the sad affair.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;362]</span>
"Lord St. Amant shot a bird," he said, "and we
hunted for it for some time. We were engaged in
beating up the next field, when some one said, 'Where
is Tropenell?' Just at that moment I heard a shot."
He waited a moment, and then went on: "It sounded
as if it were fifty yards away."</p>

<p class="indent">Again the witness paused, and then he continued
gravely: "I said in jest, 'I hope he has not shot himself!'
And Lord St. Amant said, 'Hold my gun,
Buckhurst, and I'll walk along behind the hedge, and
see if I can find him.' He got through a gap, and he
could only have gone a very few yards before we
heard him call out. 'Come at once! He's shot!' With
this we got through a gap, and ten paces on we saw
Mr. Oliver Tropenell lying on his back, parallel with
the hedge. The gun was lying across his body, the
muzzle towards the hedge. At first we could not find
the wound, but soon we discovered that he had been
shot through the heart."</p>

<p class="indent">In reply to various questions, the witness explained
how he raised Mr. Oliver Tropenell's left hand, fancying
he could detect a slight flutter of the pulse. He
called out for Dr. Turner, who happened to be a member
of the party. That gentleman came up, and after
a brief examination, said that Mr. Tropenell was certainly
dead. The charge had gone through the heart,
and death must have been practically instantaneous.
Some one, probably the keeper, opened the breech of
Mr. Tropenell's gun, and found that the cartridge in
the right-hand chamber had been exploded.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point, in answer to a word from a juryman,
Mr. Buckhurst said very decidedly that there could be
no doubt at all that the shot had been fired by Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;363]</span>
Tropenell's own gun. If he might venture to give
an informal opinion, it was perfectly plain what had
happened. The ground was rough just there, and twilight
was falling. Without doubt Mr. Tropenell, on
getting through the hedge, had stumbled heavily, the
gun had fallen forward, and then had occurred one
of those accidents which occasionally do happen out
shooting, and which no amount of care or experience
can prevent.</p>

<p class="indent">There was some little doubt as to what had been
the exact position of the body, and while this was
being discussed every one felt particularly sorry for
the dead man's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Following Mr. Buckhurst, Lord St. Amant went
into the witness-box, and then some inquisitive juryman
asked his lordship a question as to the mental
condition of the deceased. In answer to that question,
Lord St. Amant explained, with a good deal of emotion,
that just before he and Mr. Tropenell had started
out on their fatal expedition they had had a pleasant
little talk together, during which Mr. Tropenell had
seemed particularly well and cheerful. Further, the
witness threw in, as an after-thought, the statement
that the deceased gentleman had expressed considerable
gratification at the fact that his mother, Mrs.
Tropenell, and he, Lord St. Amant, had just entered
together into an engagement of marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">This announcement of a forthcoming alliance which
so closely touched the whole neighbourhood naturally
overshadowed the rest of the purely formal medical
evidence at the inquest. Very soon there remained
nothing for the jury to do but to return a verdict of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;364]</span>
"death by misadventure," and to express the deepest
sympathy with Mr. Tropenell's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">A great deal of deep, unaffected sympathy, more
sincere in this case perhaps than a great deal of the
sympathy which is lavished on the bereaved in this
world, was felt for Mrs. Tropenell.</p>

<p class="indent">Her son had not only been the most devoted and
excellent of sons, but he had been such a success, such
a man to be proud of! It was also remembered that
he had done many a kindly turn to the good folk of
Pewsbury in the last eighteen months or so, since he
had come home to make the first long stay he had
made in their neighbourhood for over ten years. His
manner, if reserved, was always kindly and pleasant,
without any touch of that patronage which is sometimes
irritating in gentlemen of his sort. The townspeople
recalled, too, the dead man's intimacy with the
late Mr. Godfrey Pavely, and the more sober among
them did not fail to remind one another how curious
it was that in under a year those two men, still both
young as youth is counted nowadays, had been gathered
to their fathers.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, before Pewsbury had had time to recover
from the excitement of poor Oliver Tropenell's tragic
end, and from the announcement, given under such
painful and dramatic circumstances, of his mother's
forthcoming marriage to Lord St. Amant, yet another
thrilling sensation was provided for the inhabitants
of the little town. This was the surprising news that
Mrs. Winslow had married again!</p>

<p class="indent">The fortunate man was, it seemed, a certain Mr.
Greville Howard, one of the largest subscribers to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;365]</span>
the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund, a gentleman,
therefore, of evident social standing and wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">The ceremony had taken place at St. James's, Piccadilly,
in the presence of a few friends of the bridegroom,
and the happy pair had gone straight off to
Mr. Howard's villa in the South of France. There
Harber, Mrs. Winslow's faithful factotum, was to
join her mistress as soon as she had made the necessary
arrangements for the disposal, by auction, of the
furniture at Rosedean. Of that furniture two objects
were at the last moment withdrawn from the
sale&mdash;one was a china cabinet, and the other a rather
curious-looking old chandelier, both associated, so it
was understood, with the new Mrs. Greville Howard's
youth.</p>

<p class="indent">The auctioneer regretted these omissions from the
catalogue, for by bad luck they were the only objects
in the house which a big London dealer had come
specially down to see, and for which he had intimated
that he was prepared to give a very good price.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
